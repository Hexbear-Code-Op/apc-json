COMMENT:On this day in 1959\, U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista
  fled the country following the victory of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Mov
 ement at the Battle of Santa Clara\, marking the successful conclusion of 
 the Cuban Revolution.
DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1959\, U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Bat
 ista fled the country following the victory of Fidel Castro's 26th of July
  Movement (M-26-7) at the Battle of Santa Clara\, marking the successful c
 onclusion of the Cuban Revolution.\n\nThe 26th of July Movement takes its 
 name from the date of with a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953
 \, however\, the movement bearing this name was not formally organized unt
 il the attackers were released from prison in 1955. Public resistance cont
 inued sporadically until November 1956\, when 80 members of the M-26-7 ret
 urned from exile.\n\nSoon after landing on the island\, a separate revolut
 ionary group\, the "Directorio Revoluncionari Estudiantil" (DRE)\, unsucce
 ssfully attempted an attack on the Presidential Palace in Havana.\n\nThrou
 ghout 1957\, armed resistance from groups such as the DRE and M-26-7 would
  escalate. After a failed offensive by the government against rebels in th
 e summer of 1958\, the rebels launched a major counter-offensive.\n\nOn De
 cember 28th\, 1958\, after a fraudulent election in favor of Batista\, rev
 olutionary forces reached the city of Santa Clara. Seizing equipment from 
 an armored train intended to transport government reinforcements\, the reb
 els quickly captured the city\, prompting Batista to panic and flee to the
  Dominican Republic with a personal fortune of more than $300 million.\n\n
 In the following days\, revolutionary forces entered Havana with no resist
 ance\, and Castro established a provisional government. The 26th of July M
 ovement later reformed along Marxist–Leninist lines\, becoming the Commu
 nist Party of Cuba in October 1965.\n\nBatista later settled in fascist Sp
 ain\, dying there in 1973 at the age of 72.

 self-liberated slaves\, the culmination of years of violent revolt against
  French colonizers. More than 200\,000 Haitians died in the struggle for l
 iberation.\n\nThe Haitian Revolution was the only uprising of enslaved peo
 ple that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery\,
  and ruled by non-whites and former captives.\n\nThe revolt began on Augus
 t 21st\, 1791\, in what was then the French colony of Saint-Domingue. Thou
 sands of people began to kill their masters\, plunge the colony into civil
  war.\n\nWithin the next ten days\, slaves had taken control of the entire
  Northern Province in an uprising of unprecedented scale. The fighting was
  particularly brutal\, and more than 200\,000 black people died in the yea
 rs between the initial uprising and formal independence.\n\nAlthough Touss
 aint Louverture established himself as a military leader of the revolution
  by 1801\, he died shortly before independence was won. Jean-Jacques Dessa
 lines\, his former lieutenant\, became the first leader of Haiti.

 from the United States.\n\nThe arrests occurred under the leadership of At

  556 people were deported\, including prominent anti-capitalist thinkers l

DESCRIPTION:Antonie Pannekoek\, born on this day in 1873\, was a Dutch ast
 ronomer\, philosopher\, Marxist theorist\, and socialist revolutionary.\n\
 nA respected Marxist theorist\, Pannekoek was one of the founders of counc
 il communism and a main figure in the radical left in the Netherlands and 
 Germany\, active in the Communist Party of the Netherlands\, the Communist
  Workers' Party of the Netherlands and the Communist Workers' Party of Ger
 many.\n\nPannekoek is perhaps best known for his writing on workers' counc
 ils. He regarded these as a new form of organization capable of overcoming
  the limitations of the old institutions of the labor movement\, the trade
  unions and social democratic parties.\n\nPannekoek was a sharp critic of 
 anarchism\, social democracy\, and Leninism. During the early years of the
  Russian revolution\, Pannekoek gave critical support to the Bolsheviks. I
 n later analysis\, however\, Pannekoek argued that the Bolsheviks crippled
  the workers' soviets\, and formed a new ruling class of their own party.\
 n\nUnlike other progressive thinkers of his time\, Pannekoek was also high
 ly critical of Social Darwinism\, derisively calling it "bourgeois darwini
 sm".\n\n"Public ownership is a middle-class program of a modernized and di
 sguised form of capitalism. Common ownership by the producers can be the o
 nly goal of the working class."\n\n- Antonie Pannekoek

 He also participated in the Selma to Montgomery protest march in March 196

 to drive a group of black people to get registered to vote in Lee County\,
  Alabama. Younge continued his efforts to get blacks registered to vote in
  Macon County\, Alabama for four months after being released from jail\, u
 p until his death.\n\nOn January 3rd\, 1966\, Younge was shot and killed b
 y a gas station clerk after trying to use a "whites only" bathroom in his 
 hometown of Tuskegee. Earlier that day\, Younge had brought 40 people to r
 egister to vote at Macon County Courthouse\, where he was threatened with 
 a knife by a registrar.\n\nAt 21 years of age\, Younge became the first bl
 ack university student to be killed in the civil rights movement. His murd
 erer was quickly arrested\, indicted\, and found not guilty by an all-whit
 e jury. This led to widespread protests in Tuskegee and SNCC to formally c
 ome out in opposition to the Vietnam War. The SNCC issued a statement on J
 anuary 6th\, 1966\, saying:\n\n"We believe the United States government ha
 s been deceptive in its claims of concern for the freedom of the Vietnames

 or the freedom of colored people in such other countries as the Dominican 
 Republic\, the Congo\, South Africa\, Rhodesia\, and in the United States

  indigenous leader who coordinated decade-long resistance to the process o

 perception\, modern historians note his restraint - he had not exacted rev
 enge for his brother's murder at the hands of a settler and rival tribe an
 d had saved at least one settler's life in a raid.\n\nIn 1854\, Dundalli e
 ntered Brisbane to be paid for removing a felled tree and was arrested by 
 the police. Tried and convicted for murder on flimsy evidence\, he was han

  that\, from the gallows\, Dundalli gave a speech addressed to his wife an
 d Turrbal\, Ningy Ningy\, and Djindubari people gathered nearby\, calling 
 on them to avenge his death.\n\nConnors states "In the end\, the theatre o

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1966\, the SNCC adopted an official stance agai
 nst the Vietnam War\, connecting the struggle for liberation at home to Vi
 etnamese liberation struggle. "We ask\, where is the draft for the freedom
  fight in the United States?"\n\nThe Student Nonviolent Coordinating Commi
 ttee (SNCC) was the principal channel of student commitment in the United 
 States to the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s. The group emerged in
  1960 from the student-led sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Greensb
 oro\, North Carolina and Nashville\, Tennessee and played a key role in he
 lping black people in the South both register and exercise their right to 
 vote.\n\nIn a November 1965 staff meeting\, SNCC decided to issue a public
  statement about the Vietnam War\, although some workers voiced concern ab
 out the political consequences. One worker wrote "While we care a great de
 al about both Vietnam and civil rights\, we can’t do anything to help th
 e Vietnam situation\, and we can hurt ourselves by trying."\n\nOn January 
 3rd\, 1966\, twenty-one year old civil rights activist Sammy Younge was mu
 rdered by white supremacists in Tuskegee\, Alabama. His death pushed SNCC 
 to make a public stance on the war\, regardless of the political consequen
 ces.\n\nThree days later\, on January 6th\, SNCC’s Executive Committee r
 eleased a statement on the Vietnam War\, writing "the murder of Samuel You
 ng in Tuskegee\, Alabama\, is no different than the murder of peasants in 
 Vietnam\, for both Young and the Vietnamese sought\, and are seeking\, to 
 secure the rights guaranteed them by law." Here is an excerpt from their s
 tatement:\n\n"We believe the United States government has been deceptive i
 n its claims of concern for the freedom of the Vietnamese people\, just as
  the government has been deceptive in claiming concern for the freedom of 
 colored people in other countries as the Dominican Republic\, the Congo\, 
 South Africa\, Rhodesia\, and in the United States itself.\n\n...We questi
 on\, then\, the ability and even the desire of the United States governmen
 t to guarantee free elections abroad. We maintain that our country's cry o
 f 'preserve freedom in the world' is a hypocritical mask\, behind which it
  squashes liberation movements which are not bound\, and refuse to be boun
 d\, by the expediencies of United States cold war policies.\n\n...We recoi
 l with horror at the inconsistency of a supposedly 'free' society where re
 sponsibility to freedom is equated with the responsibility to lend oneself
  to military aggression...We ask\, where is the draft for the freedom figh
 t in the United States?"

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1919\, the "Semana Trágica" began in Argentina
  when police attacked striking metalworkers in Buenos Aires\, killing five
 \, after workers set the police chief's car on fire. The city was quickly 
 placed under martial law.\n\nThe "Semana Trágica" (Tragic Week in English
 \, not to be confused with the Spanish Tragic Week) was the violent supres
 sion of a general workers' uprising\, beginning with the attack on January
  7th. In addition to the actions of the police and military\, right-wing v
 igilantes launched pogroms against the city's Jews\, many of whom were not
  involved\, in order to suppress the rebellion.\n\nThe conflict began as a
  strike at the Vasena metal works\, an English Argentine-owned plant in th
 e suburbs of Buenos Aires. On January 7th\, workers overturned and set fir
 e to the car of the police chief Elpidio González. Militant workers also 
 shot and killed the commander of the Army detachment protecting González.
  Following this\, police attacked\, killing five workers and wounding twen
 ty more.\n\nOn the same day\, maritime workers of the port of Buenos Aires
  voted in favor of a general strike for better hours and wages. After the 
 police attack at Vasena\, a waterfront strike began: all ship movements\, 
 and all loading and unloading\, came to a halt.\n\nRioting soon spread thr
 oughout Buenos Aires\, and workers battled with both state and right-wing 
 paramilitary forces. Police utilized members of the far-right Argentine "P
 atriotic League"\, who targeted the city's working class Russian Jewish po
 pulation\, which they associated with the rebellion\, beating and murderin
 g many uninvolved civilians.\n\nOn the 11th\, the city was placed under ma
 rtial law\, and the military restored control over the city over the next 
 several days. Estimates of the death toll range from between 141 to over 7
 00. The United States embassy reported that 1\,500 people were killed in t
 otal\, "mostly Russians and generally Jews"\, and that many women were rap

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1972\, all the coal miners in Britain went on s
 trike\, the first official national miners' strike since 1926. After the B
 attle of Saltley Gate rendered the last large stockpile of fuel inaccessib
 le in February\, workers won their demands.\n\nThe dispute arose from pay 
 negotiations. Miners\, led by Joe Gormley\, initially asked for pay rises 
 of between 35-47%\, while the National Coal Board (NCB) was only prepared 
 to offer 7.4%. After the strike began\, all 289 coal mines in the country 
 ceased production.\n\nAt the beginning of the strike\, it was estimated th
 at there were sufficient stockpiles of fuel to supply national requirement
 s for about 8 weeks\, however the fuel was unevenly distributed throughout
  the country. The success of the strike depended on ensuring the scarcity 
 of fuel.\n\nAccordingly\, the miners enjoyed solidarity from other industr
 ies - engineers ceased working at collieries\, train drivers refused to dr
 ive trains carrying fuel\, and dockworkers refused to unload ships carryin
 g coal.\n\nUnder guidelines agreed between the National Union of Mineworke
 rs (NUM)\, the NCB\, and the government\, dispensation was given to allow 
 fuel to be transported to "priority consumers"\, i.e.\, hospitals\, nursin
 g homes\, orphanages\, and\, later\, schools.\n\nBy February\, the last la
 rge accessible stockpile of solid fuel in the country was held by a West M
 idlands Gas Board (WMGB) coke plant in Birmingham\, where up to 700 vehicl
 es were collecting fuel each day for in miles-long queues. The WMGB argued
  that they could stay open because they did not employ miners directly.\n\
 nThousands of picketing workers descended on the open coke works\, attempt
 ing to close it\, but were initially repelled by a large police force. Art
 hur Scargill\, a left-wing leader of the strike and NUM member\, asked for
  solidarity from local engineering unions.\n\nWith their support\, more th
 an 10\,000 workers managed to close the depot on February 10th\, an event 
 known as "The Battle of Saltley Gate". With the country facing massive pow
 er outages\, the government conceded to worker demands.\n\n"The victory on
  the 10 February was a battle between the working class and the government
 \, which the working class won."\n\n- Peter Jackson\, of the Birmingham Tr
 ades Council

  they successfully destroyed three of Gobu's four gates\, occupied governm

  Chinese Qing dynasty for support. Doing this\, however\, aggrieved the Ja
 panese government\, which was competing with China for influence over Kore
 a.\n\nJapan invaded Korea\, occupying Seoul\, triggering the First Sino-Ja
 panese War. Following a temporary truce\, the peasant rebellion would resu

  Japanese proved successful in defeating the uprising\, however\, continui

 he massacre happened following revolutionary marches by the anarcho-syndic
 alist union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Earlier in January\
 , two government guards were wounded in one of these demonstrations.\n\nTh
 e Second Spanish Republic (not to be confused with the socialist governmen
 ts during the Spanish Civil War)\, forcibly suppressed this working class 
 movement. On January 11th\, 1933\, the "Civil Guard" and "Assault Guard" a
 rrived in the village Casas Viejas. Many of the villagers fled\, but some 
 anarchists tried to resist arrest and barricaded themselves in the home of
  an anarchist\, Francisco Cruz Gutiérrez\, who was nicknamed Seisdedos.\n
 \nWhen guards under the command of Captain Rojas arrived\, they set the ho
 use on fire with the anarchists and their families still inside. One anarc
 hist\, Maria Silva Cruz\, survived the fire and emerged with a child\, a b
 oy\, still alive.\n\nSoldiers and police then arrested anyone in the villa
 ge who possessed a gun\, marched them to the smoking ashes of the cottage 
 and their dead colleagues\, and shot them in the back. Between twenty-one 
 and twenty-four people died during the incident.\n\nThe massacre led to wi
 despread outrage among left-wing groups\, some of which had previously par
 ticipated in the Second Spanish Republic\, significantly undermining suppo
 rt for and compliance with the government.

DESCRIPTION:The Lawrence Textile Strike\, also known as the Bread and Rose
 s Strike\, began on this day in 1912 in Massachusetts. Workers\, mostly im
 migrant women and children\, won their demands after months of violence an
 d national press campaigns.\n\nThe strike was led by the Industrial Worker
 s of the World (IWW) and united immigrant workers of over forty nationalit
 ies. Prompted by a two-hour pay cut following a new law shortening women's
  workweeks\, the strike spread rapidly through the town\, growing to more 
 than twenty thousand workers and involving nearly every mill in Lawrence.\
 n\nNational attention to the strike greatly increased when two IWW leaders
 \, "Smiling Joe" Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti\, were arrested on fabricate
 d charges related to the murder of a striking worker. Upon their arrest\, 
 "Big Bill" Haywood and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn took over leadership of the 
 strike. They further sensationalized the condition of the striking workers
  by ostentatiously sending their hungry children to stay with families and
  supporters in New York City.\n\nStriking workers and families were brutal
 ized by police. When authorities tried to prevent more children from leavi
 ng the city\, the police attacked a crowd of parents and their children\, 
 causing one pregnant woman to miscarry.\n\nGrowing national sympathy for t
 he strikers finally led the mill owners to agree to worker demands\, and t
 he parties agreed on significant pay raises to return to work.\n\nEttor an
 d Giovannitti were in prison for months after the strike ended\, but were 
 eventually acquitted of all charges.

 7\, 3\,000 workers met to organize a strike\, which began on the 13th with
  more than 15\,000 workers\, approximately 75% of the workforce in Mombasa
 \, engaging in a general strike.\n\nThe labor stoppage crossed many indust
 ries\, including government\, railroad\, hotel\, domestic workers\, and do
 ck workers. Taxi drivers went around the city spreading word of the strike
  and urging others to participate.\n\nThe government immediately declared 
 the strike illegal\, citing the "Defense Regulations"\, which mandated the
  port at Mombasa to stay open\, as it was the only major access site to Ke
 nya Colony and Uganda.\n\nDespite this\, workers persisted\, meeting every
  day at a soccer field to organize. On the second day of the strike\, 10\,
 000 workers showed up to the daily meeting\, which was run with no officia
 l leader\, giving everyone an opportunity to speak.\n\nAfter more than a w
 eek of the city being paralyzed\, a government official promised to gain i
 mprovements in working conditions within three months if the people would 
 end their strike. Workers agreed and\, on January 25th\, 1947\, all worker
 s returned to their jobs.\n\nAt the end of March\, workers were given a 20
 -40% wage increase\, housing allowances\, paid holidays\, paid overtime\, 
 and a higher minimum wage.

DESCRIPTION:Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\, born on this day in 1809\, was a Fren
 ch politician\, philosopher\, and founder of mutualist philosophy.\n\nProu
 dhon was the first person to declare himself an anarchist and is widely re
 garded as one of the ideology's most influential theorists\, sometimes cal
 led "the father of anarchism". He became a member of the French Parliament
  after the Revolution of 1848\, afterwards referring to himself as a feder
 alist.\n\nProudhon favored workers' associations or co-operatives as well 
 as individual worker and peasant possession over private ownership or the 
 nationalization of land and workplaces. In "The Confessions of a Revolutio
 nary"\, Proudhon asserted that "Anarchy is Order Without Power"\, the phra
 se which much later inspired in the view of some the anarchist circled-A s
 ymbol.\n\nIt is worth noting that\, despite his egalitarian beliefs in oth
 er respects\, Proudhon was an avowed sexist and anti-Semite. One unpublish
 ed quote reads "The Jew is the enemy of the human race. This race must be 
 sent back to Asia\, or exterminated." Proudhon also maintained that a woma
 n's choice was to be "courtesan or housekeeper"\, stating that man is "a f
 ather\, a chief\, a master: above all\, a master".\n\nThese views did not 
 go uncontested amongst his colleagues. Joseph Déjacque\, a contemporary l
 ibertarian communist\, told Proudhon to "speak out against man's exploitat
 ion of woman" or "do not describe yourself as an anarchist".\n\nProudhon u
 nsuccessfully tried to create a national bank\, to be funded by what becam
 e an abortive attempt at an income tax on capitalists and shareholders. Si
 milar in some respects to a credit union\, it would have given interest-fr
 ee loans.\n\n"I build no system. I ask an end to privilege\, the abolition
  of slavery\, equality of rights\, and the reign of law. Justice\, nothing

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1977\, French mercenaries attempted to overthro
 w the People's Republic of Benin. President Kérékou’s Presidential Gua
 rd\, aided by North Korean soldiers\, effectively repelled the invading fo
 rce\, and the coup failed.\n\nFollowing a coup of young military officers 
 in 1972\, the junta government of Benin (then known as Dahomey) would coop
 erate closely with various domestic socialist political groups.\n\nThis le
 ftward turn would culminate in President Mathieu Kérékou proclaiming the
  formal accession of his government to Marxism-Leninism in 1974\, and the 
 official establishment of the People's Republic of Benin in 1975.\n\nBenin
 's turn towards socialism would draw the ire of its former colonial master
 \, France. A small group of Beninese political exiles would make their hom
 e in France and conspire with Robert Denard\, a notorious French\, anti-co
 mmunist\, imperialist mercenary.\n\nDenard and the exiles would form a sma
 ll army of around 150 hired guns. Led by Denard\, this group created a pla
 nned to depose Kérékou and received funds\, arms\, and training from sev
 eral pro-French African governments\, including Morocco\, Togo\, and the I
 vory Coast.\n\nThe mercenaries departed from a Gabonese airstrip in the ea
 rly hours of January 16th\, 1977\, disguised as a civilian aircraft and de
 stined for Cotonou\, the executive seat of the government of Benin.\n\nUpo
 n landing at the Cotonou airport around 7 am\, the mercenaries quickly too
 k control of both air traffic control and the airport's main terminal\, th
 en advanced towards the Presidential Palace.\n\nKérékou\, informed of th
 e ongoing assault\, would call on civilians over the radio to take up arms
  in defense against the coup. The Army\, Presidential Guard\, which Presid
 ent Kérékou had expanded North Korean soldiers\, and armed civilians def
 end the Presidential Palace until the mercenaries retreated back to the ai
 rport and returned to Gabon.\n\nSeven Beninese were killed during the atta
 ck: 6 soldiers and 1 civilian. A large monument in central Cotonou was ere
 cted in their memory in 1979.\n\nToday\, January 16th is celebrated as Mar
 tyr's Day in Benin to commemorate those who lost their lives fighting agai
 nst neo-colonialism.

DESCRIPTION:Patrice Lumumba was a Congolese anti-colonial revolutionary as
 sassinated by U.S. and Belgian assisted forces on this day in 1961\, after
  serving as Prime Minister. Lumumba had served as the first Prime Minister
  of the independent Democratic Republic of the Congo from June until Septe
 mber 1960\, and played a significant role in the transformation of the Con
 go from a colony of Belgium into an independent republic.\n\nIdeologically
  an African nationalist and pan-Africanist\, Lumumba led the Congolese Nat
 ional Movement (MNC) party from 1958 until his assassination\, in a coup b
 y Joseph-Désiré Mobutu\, assisted by U.S. and Belgian forces. The coup o
 ccurred when Lumumba\, facing armed rebellion and an occupation by Belgian
  forces\, asked for support from the Soviet Union. This led to a governmen
 t split between himself\, President Joseph Kasa-Vubu\, and military comman
 der Joseph-Désiré Mobutu.\n\nOn December 1st\, 1960\, Lumumba was captur
 ed by Mobutu's forces and imprisoned. On January 17th\, 1961\, he and his 
 associates were brutally beaten and tortured by Katangan and Belgian offic
 ers\, and Lumumba was executed later that night. The execution was carried
  out with Belgian and U.S. assistance. Belgium formally apologized for its
  role in the assassination in 2002.\n\nOn Lumumba's legacy\, his friend an
 d colleague Thomas Kanza wrote the following:\n\n"He lived as a free man\,
  and an independent thinker. Everything he wrote\, said and did was the pr
 oduct of someone who knew his vocation to be that of a liberator\, and he 
 represents for the Congo what Castro does for Cuba\, Nasser for Egypt\, Nk
 rumah for Ghana\, Mao Tse-tung for China\, and Lenin for Russia."\n\n"No C
 ongolese worthy of the name will ever to be able to forget that this indep
 endence has been won through a struggle in which we did not spare our ener
 gy and our blood...We have known ironies\, insults\, and blows which we ha
 d to undergo morning\, noon and night because we were Negroes. We have see
 n our lands spoiled in the name of laws which only recognized the right of
  the strongest. We have known laws which differed according to whether it 
 dealt with a black man or a white. We have known the atrocious sufferings 
 of those who were imprisoned for their political opinions or religious bel
 iefs\, and of those exiled in their own country. Their fate was worse than
  death itself. Who will forget the rifle-fire from which so many of our br
 others perished\, or the jails in to which were brutally thrown those who 
 did not want to submit to a regime of justice\, oppression and exploitatio
 n which were the means the colonialists employed to dominate us?"\n\n- Pat

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1912\, tramway workers in Brisbane\, Australia 
 were fired after they wore union badges despite them being banned. Their d
 ismissal led to a general strike with more than 50\,000 workers. Union bad
 ges remained banned until 1980.\n\nAt the time\, the tramways in Brisbane 
 were owned by the General Electric Company of the United Kingdom and manag
 ed by an American\, Joseph Stillman Badger\, who refused to negotiate with
  the Australian Labour Federation or let his employees wear union badges o
 n their uniform.\n\nOn January 18th\, 1912\, a large crowd of sightseers g
 athered to watch as tramway employees donned the union badges in defiance 
 of this ban. Badger addressed the wearers at the depot and gave them the c
 hoice of removing the badges or not working\; most chose the right to wear
  the badges\, and later 10\,000 workers marched to modern day King George 
 Square to listen to labor organizers speak.\n\nForty-three Brisbane based 
 Trade Unions subsequently formed the Combined Unions Committee and appoint
 ed a General Strike Committee. The General Strike Committee planned for a 
 general strike on January 30th and began functioning as an alternative gov
 ernment in the area\, whose approval became needed for work to be done.\n\
 nAs planned\, trade unionists of Brisbane went out on a general strike Jan
 uary 30th\, 1912\, not just for the right to wear a badge but also for the
  basic right to join a union. Brisbane was brought to a standstill by the 
 next day - trains didn't run\, hotels were closed\, most transport shut do
 wn\, and most food shops were closed. Only shops with special permits issu
 ed by the Committee were opened in order to keep the Australian government
  running at the minimal margin.\n\nWorkers celebrated with parades\, speec
 hes\, and sporting contests. The government began prohibiting these demons
 trations\, and\, when 15\,000 workers defied this ban on February 2nd\, 19
 12\, they were attacked by police. Strikers and their family members were 
 beaten and arrested en masse.\n\nEmma Miller\, a 70-year old trade unionis
 t and suffragist\, stood her ground and stabbed the rump of the Police Com
 missioner's horse. The horse threw the Commissioner to the ground\, giving
  him life-long limp.\n\nThe strike failed due to a lack of money and parti
 cularly food. It officially ended when the Employers Federation\, supporti
 ng the strike\, agreed on the March 6th\, 1912 that there would be no vict
 imization of strikers from Badger and the company.\n\nDespite this\, many 
 workers who had participated were blacklisted by Badger until 1922\, when 
 the Queensland Government acquired the tram system and reinstated them. We
 aring of union badges on uniforms remained forbidden until 1980.

DESCRIPTION:Amílcar Cabral was a Bissau-Guinean and Cape Verdean agricult
 ural engineer\, intellectual\, and communist revolutionary who was assassi
 nated on this day in 1973 by a PAIGC veteran and Portuguese agents. Cabral
  was one of Africa's foremost anti-colonial leaders\, leading the national
 ist movement of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde Islands and the ensuing war o
 f independence in Guinea-Bissau.\n\nFrom 1963 until his death\, he led the
  Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde (PAIGC) guerril
 la movement against the Portuguese government\, beginning a decade-long\, 
 but ultimately successful war of liberation. The goal of the conflict was 
 to achieve independence from both Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde.\n\nCab
 ral was assassinated on January 20th\, 1973 by at PAIGC headquarters in Co
 nakry by PAIGC veteran Inocêncio Kani and Portuguese agents\, according t
 o historian Lucy Burnett. Eight months later\, Guinea-Bissau issued a unil
 ateral declaration of independence. Cabral's pan-Africanism and revolution
 ary socialism continues to be an inspiration for socialists and national i
 ndependence movements worldwide.\n\n"In combating racism we do not make pr
 ogress if we combat the people themselves. We have to combat the causes of
  racism. If a bandit comes to my house and I have a gun\, I cannot shoot t
 he shadow of the bandit\; I have to shoot the bandit. Many people lose ene
 rgy and effort\, and make sacrifices combating shadows. We have to combat 
 the material reality that produces the shadow."\n\n- Amílcar Cabral

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1942\, leading Nazi officials met at a villa in
  Wannsee\, Berlin\, to discuss the "Jewish question". Here\, the policy of
  Jewish genocide was explicitly architected\, although the "Final Solution
 " had been approved one year earlier.\n\nThe conference was attended by 15
  high-ranking party and state officials\, headed by Reinhard Heydrich\, SS
  Lieutenant-General and head of the Reich Security Main Office. Other impo
 rtant attendees included Heinrich Müller\, chief of the Gestapo\, and Ado
 lf Eichmann\, who was executed in 1962 for war crimes in Jerusalem.\n\nBec
 ause a policy of mass extermination had already been approved by Hitler in
  1941 (especially as mass killings of Jews had already begun in occupied E
 urope)\, the historical importance of the meeting was not recognized by th

  Solution's" implementation was simply to emphasize that\, once the deport
 ations had been completed\, the fate of the deportees became an internal m
 atter of the SS\, totally outside the purview of any other agency. Heydric
 h estimated that there were around 11 million Jews in Europe who would be 
 targeted for extermination. Within a few months of the Wannsee Conference\
 , the Nazis would begin installing the first poison-gas chambers in Polish
  extermination camps.\n\nOn January 20th\, 1992\, on the fiftieth annivers

 Dáil and Sinn Féin\, and the conflict intensified.\n\nOver the following
  two years\, the IRA waged a campaign of guerilla warfare against British

  British-aligned forces\, 491 of the Irish-aligned forces\, and 900 civili

DESCRIPTION:Itō Noe\, born on this day in 1895\, was a Japanese anarchist
 \, social critic\, and feminist author. She was the editor-in-chief of the
  feminist magazine "Seitō"\, although the magazine eventually folded due 
 to lack of funds because the government would not let distributors carry i

 w anarchist Sakae Ōsugi\, and continued to gain prominence as a feminist 
 and anarchist writer. She was highly critical of the existing political sy
 stem in Japan\, which led her to call for an anarchism to exist in "everyd
 ay practice"\, namely that people should in various small ways seek routin
 ely to undermine the kokutai (a sense of national body politic). Itō also
  translated anarchist writings into Japanese\, including works of Emma Gol
 dman.\n\nOn September 16th\, 1923\, Itō\, Ōsugi\, and his 6-year-old nep
 hew Munekazu were arrested\, strangled to death\, and thrown into an aband
 oned well by a squad of military police known as the "Kenpeitai". The kill
 ing of such high-profile anarchists\, together with a young child\, became
  a national controversy known as the "Amakasu Incident" (named after the l

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1924\, revolutionary Vladimir Lenin died after 
 a series of strokes. Following his death\, his wife Krupskaya circulated "
 Lenin's Testament"\, a letter in which he criticized Party leadership and 
 made suggestions for the future.\n\nThe majority of the Testament had been
  dictated by Lenin to his secretary\, Lidya Fotieva\, on December 25th\, 1
 922\, with a postscript added on January 4th\, 1923\, approximately a year
  before his death.\n\nIn the letter\, Lenin expressed concerns over the st
 ability of the Central Committee\, and by extension the Communist Party\, 
 writing "Our party rests upon two classes\, and for that reason its instab
 ility is possible\, and if there cannot exist an agreement between such cl
 asses its fall is inevitable...I have in mind stability as a guarantee aga
 inst a split n the near future\, and I intend to examine here a series of 
 considerations of a purely personal character."\n\nLenin goes on to state 
 that the personal relationship between Stalin and Trotsky could cause such
  a split: "I think that the fundamental factor in the matter of stability 
 – from this point of view – as such members of the Central Committee a
 s Stalin and Trotsky. The relation between them constitutes\, in my opinio
 n\, a big half of the danger of that split..."\n\nIn the letter's postscri
 pt\, dated January 4th\, Lenin calls Stalin "rude" and recommends Party me
 mbers to find another General Secretary\, "another man who in all respects
  differs from Stalin only in superiority – namely\, more patient\, more 
 loyal\, more polite and more attentive to comrades\, less capricious\, etc
 ."\n\nAfter\, Lenin's death\, his surviving widow\, Nadezhda\, began circu
 lating the document and attempted to present it at the 13th Congress. By a
  vote of 30 to 10\, party leadership refused to have the document read to 
 the congress. The Testament was\, however\, published by anti-communists\;
  the full English text of Lenin's testament was published as part of a 192
 6 New York Times article.\n\nBill Bland\, a Marxist-Leninist historian\, n
 otes that the contents of the letter mark a striking reversal to Lenin's p
 revious assessment of both Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin had been elected Gen
 eral Secretary of the Central Committee in April 1922 on Lenin's proposal.
  While Lenin praises Trotsky as the "the most able man in the present Cent
 ral Committee" in the letter\, Lenin had previously referred to Trotsky as
  "Judas Trotsky" and "swine".\n\nHistorian Stephen Kotkin argued that the 
 evidence for Lenin's authorship of the Testament is weak and suggested tha
 t the document could have been created by Krupskaya\, although other histo
 rians\, such as Isaac Deutscher and Dmitri Volkogonov\, accepted its legit
 imacy. Trotskyist journal The New International noted in 1935 that Stalin 
 himself acknowledged Lenin as the author in a 1927 speech.

 d upon a huge procession of working class demonstrators\, killing hundreds
 . The massacre\, known as "Bloody Sunday"\, led to widespread uprisings an

 The revolt took place amidst widespread discontent with conditions under t

 , the beginning of the revolution is typically marked by the "Bloody Sunda

  Winter Palace to present a petition to Tsar Nicholas were fired upon by s
 oldiers\, killing hundreds.\n\nIn response to the massacre\, mass worker r
 esistance exploded across the Russian empire. Half of European Russia's in
 dustrial workers went on strike in 1905\, 93.2% in Poland. The Tsar's uncl
 e was assassinated on February 17th.\n\nOn March 2nd\, the Tsar agreed to 
 the establishment of a legislature\, the State Duma. However\, with the bo

  the rebels were emboldened to push harder.\n\nSummer saw peasant rebellio
 n and mutinies (Russia being at war with Japan at the time)\, most famousl

 n\nThe uprising is considered the predecessor to the Russian Revolution of
  1917 which led to the establishment of the Soviet Union\; Vladimir Lenin 
 called it "The Great Dress Rehearsal"\, without which the "victory of the 
 October Revolution in 1917 would have been impossible".

 PAIGC.\n\nThe first act of the revolution took place on January 23rd\, whe
 n PAIGC guerrillas attacked a Portuguese garrison in Tite\, near the Corub
 al River\, south of Bissau. Similar guerrilla actions quickly spread acros
 s the colony. PAIGC had few weapons - perhaps only one submachine gun and 
 two pistols per group - and so they attacked Portuguese convoys to gain mo
 re weapons.\n\nThe war ended when Portugal\, after the Carnation Revolutio

 pendence following a year later.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1977\, the Atocha Massacre took place when Span
 ish fascists assassinated five labor activists from the Communist Party of
  Spain (PCE) and the workers' federation "Comisiones Obreras".\n\nThe nigh
 t of January 24th\, three fascists entered a legal office run by the PCE i
 n support of workers' rights. Their target was Joaquín Navarro\, the gene
 ral secretary of the transport union of the Comisiones Obreras\, who at th
 at time was leading a transport strike in Madrid. The attackers searched t
 he office\, found the eight remaining staff\, and\, discovering Navarro ha
 d departed earlier\, decided to kill all present.\n\nTold to raise their "
 little hands up high"\, the remaining eight people present were lined up a
 gainst a wall and shot\, killing four people (the fifth victim was killed 
 earlier) and injuring four more. One of the injured\, Dolores Ruiz\, was p
 regnant and lost her child as a result of the attack.\n\nThe assassination
 s took place within the wider context of far-right reaction to Spain's tra
 nsition to constitutional democracy following the death of dictator Franci
 sco Franco two years prior.\n\nIntended to provoke a violent left-wing res
 ponse that would provide legitimacy for a subsequent right-wing counter co
 up d'état\, the massacre had an immediate and opposite effect\, causing m
 ass popular revulsion against the far-right and accelerating the legalizat
 ion of the long-banned Communist Party.\n\nThe trial took place in Februar
 y 1980 and the defendants were sentenced to a total of 464 years in jail. 
 A number of them escaped custody\, however\, fleeing to South America. Aft
 er more than 20 years on the run\, one the perpetrators\, García Juliá\,
  was arrested in Brazil in 2018. Juliá was extradited to Spain in Februar
 y 2020\, and transferred to Soto del Real prison to serve the remainder of
  his sentence.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1911\, the Japanese government executed twelve 
 anarchists\, including radical journalists Kanno Sugako and Kōtoku Shūsu
 i (shown)\, as part of a widespread crackdown on left-wing activism. Among
  those executed were Uchiyama Gudō\, a Buddhist priest and socialist who 
 spoke out against the Meiji government for its imperialism and advocated f
 or conscripted soldiers to desert en masse.\n\nThe pretext for this crackd
 own was the "High Treason Incident"\, a plot to assassinate the Emperor of
  Japan. The incident began when police searched the room of Miyashita Taki
 chi\, a young lumbermill employee\, and found materials which could be use
 d to construct bombs\, concluding that there was a broader conspiracy to h
 arm the imperial family.\n\nOn the basis of this plot\, the Japanese gover
 nment rounded up leftist activists from all over the country. 24 of the 26
  defendants actually brought to trial were sentenced to death\, despite th
 e evidence against nearly all of them being circumstantial.\n\nAmong those
  executed anarcha-feminist journalist Kanno Sugako (some sources say she w
 as executed on January 25th). At the age of 29\, Kanno became the first wo
 man with the status of political prisoner to be executed in the history of
  modern Japan.\n\nPrior to his execution\, Kōtoku Shūsui etched this mes
 sage on the wall of his cell: "How has it come about that I have committed
  this grave crime? Today my trial is hidden from outside observers and I h
 ave even less liberty than previously to speak about these events. Perhaps
  in 100 years someone will speak out about them on my behalf."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1979\, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee\, a 
 labor union representing migrant farm workers\, initiated a boycott agains
 t Campbell's and Nestle products to achieve union recognition and higher w
 ages. The Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) was founded in 1967 in To
 ledo\, Ohio by Baldemar Velasquez.\n\nIn 1978\, Velasquez planned an ambit
 ious labor action\, noting that Ohio tomato growers would be unable to rec
 ruit enough workers to see them through a long strike. That year\, 2\,000 
 FLOC members walked off their jobs in Ohio\, demanding a guaranteed minimu
 m wage\, better housing\, and medical care.\n\nWhile some growers were wil
 ling to negotiate\, big canners such as Campbell's and Nestle were unwilli
 ng to pay the higher prices which would accompany a unionized workforce. F
 LOC reacted by boycotting their products and marching 560 miles from Toled
 o\, Ohio to Campbell's headquarters in Camden\, New Jersey in a well-publi
 cized protest.\n\nA resolution finally came in 1986 when FLOC\, growers\, 
 and Campbell's announced a collective bargaining agreement which achieved 
 union recognition and provided for wage increases\, grievance resolution\,
  health insurance\, and committees to study pesticide safety\, housing\, h
 ealth care\, and day care issues.\n\nShortly thereafter\, FLOC reached dea
 ls with Vlasic\, Heinz\, Dean Foods\, and 23 of the largest cucumber growe
 rs in Ohio and Michigan.

 s perhaps best remembered for her "The Prison Memoirs Of A Japanese Woman"
 \, written while imprisoned after being convicted of high treason against 
 the Japanese government.\n\nTogether\, Fumiko and her Korean partner Pak Y
 ol published two magazines which highlighted the problems Koreans faced un
 der Japanese imperialism and showed influences of their radical politics. 
 Sometime between 1922 and 1923\, they also established a group called "F"u
 tei-sha (Society of Malcontents)"\, which Fumiko identified as a group for
  direct action against the government.\n\nThese activities soon brought Pa
 k and Fumiko under government scrutiny. In September 1923\, the Japanese g
 overnment therefore made a number of arrests\, mostly Koreans\, on limited
  evidence\, and among those arrested were Pak and Fumiko.\n\nAfter lengthy
  judicial proceedings\, Fumiko and Pak were convicted of high treason for 
 attempting to obtain bombs with the intention of killing the emperor or hi
 s son. They were both sentenced to life in prison\, however Fumiko alleged
 ly committed suicide in her cell in 1926.\n\nHere is a short excerpt from 
 one of Fumiko's interrogations while imprisoned (text by Max Res from thea
 narchistlibrary.org):\n\nQ: Your class?\n\nA: A divine commoner.\n\nQ: How
  are you employed?\n\nA: My job is tearing down everything that currently

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1573\, the Croatian-Slovene Peasant Revolt bega
 n with an attack on the fortress of Cesargrad\, near the town of Klanjec. 
 Peasants formed their own government\, planning to abolish feudalism and e
 stablish self-rule.\n\nAmidst growing incursions by Ottoman forces into th
 e region\, local feudal lords ramped up economic demands on the local peas
 antry. One powerful noble\, Franjo (or Ferenc) Tahy was particularly notor
 ious for his cruel and violent treatment of the local populace.\n\nComplai
 nts made by peasants to the central government were ignored\, so popular r
 esistance efforts began to develop. The local peasantry refused to pay tax
 es to Tahy\, who responded by sending armed mercenaries to attack them\, h
 owever they were defeated by armed peasants.\n\nOn the night of January 27
 -28\, rebels seized the fortress of Cesargrad\, marking the start of the r
 evolt. The peasants formed an alternative government\, with serf Matija Gu
 bec elected as leader.\n\nThe rebels made long term plans of systemic refo
 rm\, including replacing feudal lords with peasant officials\, abolishing 
 feudal land holdings and provincial borders\, canceling obligations to the
  Roman Catholic Church\, opening of highways for trade\, and establishing 
 self-rule by the peasants.\n\nNews of the uprising quickly spread through 
 the discontented lower classes of the region\, who followed suit by fighti
 ng back against their oppressors\, taking further territory throughout Car
 niola\, Croatia and Styria.\n\nThe Croatian Parliament declared the revolu
 tionary peasants traitors. After their initial wave of success\, peasant f
 orces suffered a major defeat at Krško on February 5th\, which precipitat
 ed a further wave of defeats over the coming days.\n\nThe rebels made thei
 r final stand at Stubičke Toplice on the 9th\, where the uprising was cru
 shed for good. Matija Gubec was captured\, and Ivan Mogaić\, another impo
 rtant revolutionary leader\, was killed on the battlefield.\n\nCaptives we
 re maimed and tortured by authorities\, and Gubec was publicly tortured an
 d executed on the 15th. Although the revolt was unsuccessful\, its memory 
 has persisted in the region in the centuries since\, with Gubec attaining 
 legendary status in local folklore.\n\nA detachment of Yugoslav volunteers
  for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War named themselves the "Grupo 
 Matija Gubec". In 1975\, a film based on the events entitled "Anno Domini 
 1573" was released\, and historical re-enactments of the Revolt are held i
 n Croatia every year.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1918\, the Finnish People's Delegation declared
  a socialist workers' republic (known "Red Finland")\, at the start of the
  Finnish Civil War. The burgeoning working class movement was crushed by i
 mperialist German forces.\n\nPrior to 1917\, Finland had been ruled as a G
 rand Duchy\, an autonomous part of the Russian Empire. With the collapse o
 f the Tsarist state in the wake of February Revolution and a long-term inc
 rease in nationalist sentiment\, Finland declared independence on December
  4th\, 1917\, formally recognized by the Russian Bolsheviks on December 31
 st.\n\nDue to industrialized Finland having a strong revolutionary labor m
 ovement\, conservative and proletarian forces were immediately thrown into
  conflict.\n\nRed Guard paramilitary units representing the labor movement
  found themselves in a cycle of escalation with loyalist "White" Guards\, 
 culminating in a mass uprising of Reds in Helsinki on January 27th\, 1918\
 , marking the start of revolution. The following day\, the Finnish People'
 s Delegation was formed by members of the Social Democratic Party. Bourgeo
 is forces fled to Vaasa\, where they set up their own "White Senate".\n\nT
 he war saw the Whites\, under the leadership of General Mannerheim\, recei
 ve support from the German Empire\, which was more well-established than t
 he Reds' primary ally\, the newly-created Russian Soviet Socialist Republi
 c.\n\nFollowing an imperialist intervention by Germany on the side of the 
 Whites in March 1918\, the war ended in defeat for the Reds in May. Over 1
 2\,000 people perished from starvation and hunger while imprisoned in Whit
 e-operated POW camps\, and reparations were not paid to former victims of 
 the White Terror until 1973.

COMMENT:James Larkin\, born on this day in 1874\, was an Irish republican\
 , revolutionary socialist\, and trade unionist who co-founded the industri
 al Irish Transport and General Workers' Union\, the Irish Labour Party\, a

DESCRIPTION:James Larkin\, born on this day in 1874\, was an Irish republi
 can\, revolutionary socialist\, and trade unionist who co-founded the indu
 strial Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU)\, the Irish Labo
 ur Party\, and the Irish Citizen's Army (ICA).\n\nLarkin\, also known as "
 Big Jim"\, was born to Irish emigrants and began working from the age of s
 even years old. He took an interest in socialism at a young age\, joining 
 the Independent Labour Party as a teenager.\n\nIn 1905\, while working on 
 the docks\, Larkin participated in a strike and was elected to the strike 
 committee\, losing his foreman's job as a result. The union was impressed 
 with his organizing ability\, and he later gained a permanent position wit
 h them\, beginning his career as a labor organizer.\n\nIn 1908\, Larkin be
 gan organizing in Dublin\, working with other Irish socialists such as Jam
 es Connolly and William O'Brien. He also initiated a worker's newspaper\, 
 The Irish Worker and People's Advocate\, however it was subject to censors
 hip and shut down in 1915.\n\nIn 1908\, Larkin founded the industrial Iris
 h Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU). Under Larkin's leadership 
 the union continued to grow\, reaching approximately 20\,000 members in th
 e time leading up to the Dublin lock-out.\n\nIn 1913\, led by union bustin
 g capitalist William Martin Murphy\, over 400 of Dublin's employers began 
 requiring their workers to sign a pledge not to be a member of the ITGWU a
 nd not to engage in sympathetic strikes\, causing the Dublin lock-out\, on
 e of the most severe labor conflicts in Irish history.\n\nLarkin and other
  labor leaders were arrested for sedition on August 28th while the lock-ou
 t continued. Striking workers were subject to police violence\, leading La
 rkin to call for the formation of a workers' militia\, the Irish Citizen's
  Army. During this period\, Vladimir Lenin referred to Larkin as 'a remark
 able speaker and a man of seething energy [who] has performed miracles amo
 ngst the unskilled workers'.\n\nFollowing the lock-out's defeat\, Larkin c
 ame to the United States to do a speaking tour on invitation of "Big Bill"
  Haywood of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). On November 7th\, 1
 919\, during a series of anti-Bolshevik raids\, Larkin was arrested and ch
 arged with 'criminal anarchy' for helping publish socialist literature.\n\
 nLarkin eventually returned to Ireland\, allying with the newly formed Sov
 iet Union\, attending at the 1924 Comintern Congress in Moscow. His relati
 onship with the Soviet Union became strained in the 1930s\, as Larkin's sy
 ndicalist politics clashed with the Marxism-Leninism of the Comintern.\n\n
 Larkin spent the rest of his life as a organizer\, receiving fatal injurie
 s from a fall while supervising repairs to the Worker's Union of Ireland's
  Thomas Ashe Hall in Dublin in 1946.\n\n"No\, men and women of the Irish r
 ace\, we shall not fight for England. We shall fight for the destruction o
 f the British Empire and the construction of an Irish republic."\n\n- Jame

  led by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and united immigrant wor

 pidly through the town\, growing to more than twenty thousand workers and 
 involving nearly every mill in Lawrence.\n\nLoPizzo was a striking immigra
 nt worker who was killed when\, according to IWW literature\, officer Osca
 r Benoit fired into a crowd of protesters who had been cornered and were b

DESCRIPTION:Robert Moses\, born on this day in 1935\, was an American educ
 ator and civil rights activist who led SNCC work on voter education and re
 gistration in Mississippi and co-founded the Mississippi Freedom Democrati
 c Party.\n\nDuring the civil rights era\, Moses led the Student Nonviolent
  Coordinating Committee (SNCC) committee on voter education and registrati
 on in Mississippi. Moses was also vehemently opposed to the Vietnam War\, 
 and explicitly linked his opposition to the war to the civil rights strugg
 le.\n\nLater in life\, Moses ran the Algebra Project\, a continued effort 
 to improve math education in poor communities with the goal of preparing s
 tudents for the modern workforce. At the time of the Project's founding\, 
 many middle schools\, especially those serving non-white communities\, did
  not teach algebra at all. Moses stated - "We are growing the equivalent o
 f sharecroppers in our inner cities."\n\n"I was taught about the denial of
  the right to vote behind the Iron Curtain in Europe\; I never knew that t
 here was denial of the right to vote behind a Cotton Curtain here in the U
 nited States."\n\n- Bob Moses

DESCRIPTION:Louis Allen was a civil rights activist in Liberty\, Mississip
 pi who was assassinated by white supremacists on this day in 1964. When Al
 len told the U.S. government that he feared for his life\, the Justice Dep
 artment refused to protect him.\n\nAllen had previously tried to register 
 to vote and had allegedly talked to federal officials after witnessing the
  1961 murder of Herbert Lee\, an NAACP member and volunteer with the SNCC\
 , by E. H. Hurst (1908 - 1990)\, a white Mississippi state legislator.\n\n
 Allen watched as Hurst assassinated Lee with a single gunshot to the head 
 and was forced by local police to testify in court that Hurst acted in sel
 f-defense (Hurst falsely claimed Lee attacked him a tire iron).\n\nAfter g
 iving this coerced testimony\, Allen talked to the FBI and the United Stat
 es Commission on Civil Rights in Jackson\, asking for protection if he tes
 tified about how his testimony was made under duress. The Justice Departme
 nt said they could not offer him protection\, and so Allen declined to spe
 ak out.\n\nWhen Allen reported receiving death threats\, the FBI referred 
 the matter to the office of Amite County Sheriff Daniel Jones. The FBI did
  so despite an agent acknowledging in a 1961 memo that "the local sheriff 
 was involved in the plot to kill him". FBI documentation also noted that J
 ones was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nFollowing the murder of Herbert 
 Lee\, Sheriff Jones began a campaign of harassment against Allen\, arresti
 ng him on false charges multiple times and breaking his jaw with a flashli
 ght. When Allen filed formal complaints about Jones' behavior\, they were 
 ignored.\n\nOn January 31st\, 1964\, the day before Allen had planned to m
 ove out of the state entirely\, he was assassinated on his own property. I
 n 2011\, the CBS program "60 Minutes" conducted a special on his assassina
 tion which suggested that Allen was killed by Sheriff Jones. No one has be
 en arrested or prosecuted for his murder.

DESCRIPTION:Langston Hughes\, born on this day in 1901\, was an American a

 hes moved from Joplin\, Missouri to New York City as a young man\, where h
 e began his career as an author and became one of the earliest innovators 
 of the then-new literary art form called "jazz poetry".\n\nHughes was a co
 mmunist sympathizer - his poetry was frequently published in the Communist
  Party (CPUSA) newspaper and he was involved in initiatives supported by C
 ommunist organizations\, such as the drive to free the Scottsboro Boys\, a
  group of black teens falsely accused of rape. During the Spanish Civil Wa

 an and supported the anti-fascist forces.\n\nAfter being subjected to a se
 cret government interrogation and subsequent televised Senate hearing\, le
 d by virulent anti-communist Joseph McCarthy\, Hughes distanced himself fr
 om radical politics. Biographer Laurie Leach notes that\, when selecting w
 orks for his Selected Poems (1959)\, Hughes excluded all his radical socia
 list verse from the 1930s.\n\nWhen asked why he never joined the Communist
  Party\, Hughes responded "[My not joining the Communist Party] was based 
 on strict discipline and the acceptance of directives that I\, as a writer
 \, did not wish to accept."\n\n"What happens to a dream deferred?\n\nDoes

  Organization for Women (NOW)\, which aimed to bring women "into the mains
 tream of American society now [in] fully equal partnership with men."\n\nI
 n 1970\, Friedan organized the nationwide Women's Strike for Equality on A
 ugust 26th\, the 50th anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Unite

  people. In 1971\, Friedan joined other leading feminists to establish the
  National Women's Political Caucus.\n\nFriedan's politics around feminism 
 were not always intersectional with respect to class and race. Despite the
  success NOW achieved under her leadership\, Friedan's decision to pressur

 opposition within the organization.\n\nSiding with arguments from the grou

  the povery line\, both men and women\, needed those opportunities more th
 an predominantly white upper class women.\n\nFriedan stepped down as presi

DESCRIPTION:William "Big Bill" Haywood\, born on this day in 1869\, was a 
 founding member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and a member 
 of the executive committee of the Socialist Party of America. During the f
 irst two decades of the 20th century\, Haywood was involved in several imp
 ortant labor battles\, including the Colorado Labor Wars\, the Lawrence Te
 xtile Strike\, and other textile strikes in Massachusetts and New Jersey.\
 n\nHaywood was an advocate of industrial unionism\, a labor philosophy tha
 t favors organizing all workers in an industry under one union\, regardles
 s of the specific trade or skill level. He believed that workers of all et
 hnicities should be united\, and favored direct action over political acti
 on.\n\nHaywood was renowned for leading strikes in times of crisis. When m
 artial law was declared during the Lawrence Textile Strike\, Haywood trave
 led to the strike and implemented many innovative tactics to help the work
 ers involved. One such ploy was to conspicuously send the hungry children 
 of striking workers to host families in other states\, garnering good pres
 s for the working families.\n\nIn 1917\, Big Bill Haywood was arrested for
  espionage\, along with 164 other members of the IWW. He was convicted\, a
 nd\, while temporarily released from prison due to an appeal\, fled to the
  Soviet Union\, where he served as labor advisor to Vladimir Lenin and spe
 nt the rest of life.\n\n"The mine owners did not find the gold\, they did

DESCRIPTION:The Fugitive Slave Act\, passed on this day in 1793\, was a fe
 deral law that guaranteed the right of a slaver to recover an escaped ensl
 aved person and acquire their children as property.\n\nFounding U.S. Presi
 dent George Washington used the Fugitive Slave Act twice to try and kidnap
  a 19 year old woman who escaped his bondage\, Oney Judge. According to an
  1845 article from The Liberator\, first Washington sent a man by the name
  of Bassett to persuade her to return. They told her they would set her fr
 ee when she arrived at Mount Vernon\, to which she replied "I am free now\
 , and choose to remain so."\n\nBassett would be sent a second time by Wash
 ington\, with orders to bring her and her infant child by force. New Hamps
 hire Governor John Langdon entertained Bassett while sending word to Judge
  to flee before midnight. In this way\, she successfully evaded Bassett. W
 ashington died soon after\, and no subsequent attempts were made to kidnap
  Judge or her family.\n\nOney later gave an interview in the 1840s\, stati
 ng that\, even fifty years after escaping bondage\, she and her child coul
 d still be claimed as the legal property of Washington's descendants due t
 o the Fugitive Slave Act. The law also resulted in many black people who h
 ad never been enslaved illegally claimed as such\, kidnapped\, and sold in
 to slavery.\n\nOn June 28th\, 1864\, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793\, alon
 gside a similar law in 1850\, were repealed by an act of Congress.

DESCRIPTION:Rosa Parks\, born on this day in 1913\, was an American activi

 tgomery Bus Boycott. U.S. Congress has called her "the first lady of civil
  rights" and "the mother of the freedom movement".\n\nParks was not the fi

 ciation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) believed that she wa
 s the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her 1955 a
 rrest for refusing to give up her bus seat for a white person.\n\nAccordin
 g to historian Dr. Casey Nichols\, following this arrest\, Parks immediate
 ly contacted local NAACP president E.D. Nixon and informed him of her arre
 st. Within hours\, the Women’s Political Council (WPC)\, formed in 1946 
 to address the grievances of black bus patrons in Montgomery\, sprang into
  action\, printing flyers\, phoning potential supporters\, and organizing 
 carpools.\n\nThe boycott succeeded in 1957 after the Supreme Court declare
 d bus segregation unconstitutional. Parks' act of defiance and the Montgom
 ery bus boycott became important symbols of the movement\, and she became 
 an international icon of resistance to racial segregation.\n\nAfter the bo
 ycott's conclusion\, Parks moved to Detroit\, Michigan and began working a
 s an assistant to Detroit Congressman John Conyers. She has received numer
 ous honors\, including over 40 honorary degrees\, the Medal of Freedom\, t
 he Congressional Gold Medal of Honor\, and two NAACP image awards. In 2002
 \, Parks produced a biographical film titled “The Rosa Parks Story.”\n

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1919\, a general strike involving ~100\,000 wor
 kers in Seattle began. Workers\, vilified as "Bolsheviki"\, set up an alte
 rnative government that distributed 30\,000 meals daily and a police force
  that did not carry weapons.\n\nDissatisfied workers in several unions beg
 an the strike to gain higher wages after two years of World War I wage con
 trols. Government officials\, the press\, and much of the public viewed th
 e strike as a radical attempt to subvert American institutions.\n\nDuring 
 the strike\, a cooperative body made up of rank and file workers from all 
 the striking locals was formed\, called the General Strike Committee. It a
 cted as a "virtual counter-government for the city"\, according to labor h
 istorian Jeremy Brecher.\n\nThe committee organized to provide essential s
 ervices for the people of Seattle during the work stoppage. A system of fo
 od distribution was also established\, which distributed as many as 30\,00
 0 meals each day.\n\nArmy veterans created an alternative to the police in
  order to maintain order. A group called the "Labor War Veteran's Guard" f
 orbade the use of force and did not carry weapons\, using "persuasion only
 ". Major General John F. Morrison\, stationed in Seattle\, claimed that he
  had never seen "a city so quiet and orderly."\n\nOn February 7th\, Mayor 
 Ole Hanson threatened to use 1\,500 police and 1\,500 troops to replace st

 hreat and were proved correct. A few days later\, Hanson stated the "sympa

 AFL)\, began to exert pressure on the General Strike Committee and individ

 AFL and international labor organizations\, proposed ending the general st

  by the General Strike Committee.\n\nOn February 10th\, the General Strike
  Committee voted to end the general strike the following day\, listing the
  following reasons: "Pressure from international officers of unions\, from
  executive committees of unions\, from the 'leaders' in the labor movement
 \, even from those very leaders who are still called 'Bolsheviki' by the u
 ndiscriminating press. And\, added to all these\, the pressure upon the wo
 rkers themselves\, not of the loss of their own jobs\, but of living in a 
 city so tightly closed."\n\nImmediately following the general strike's end
 \, the Socialist Party headquarters was raided by police\, and thirty-nine
  IWW members were arrested as "ringleaders of anarchy" despite playing a m
 arginal role in the strike's development.

COMMENT:On this day in 1894\, miners in Cripple Creek\, Colorado went out

 disbanded by state militia.
DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1894\, miners in Cripple Creek\, Colorado went 
 out on strike to fight against wage cuts. The town was placed under martia
 l law and brutalized by an illegal\, mercenary army of deputies who had to
  be disbanded by state militia.\n\nPrior to the strike\, mine owners in Cr
 ipple Creek had attempted to expand the 8-hour day at $3.00 a day to a 10-
 hour day. When miners protested the increased hours\, their employers kept
  the 8-hour day\, but at a decreased wage of $2.50 a day.\n\nSoon after th
 ese changes were implemented\, organized miners became affiliated with the
  Western Federation of Miners (WFM). After mine owners ignored union presi
 dent John Calderwood's demands for an 8-hour day at the $3.00 wage\, the u
 nion struck on February 7th\, 1894.\n\nBy the end of February\, every smel
 ter in Colorado was either closed or running part-time. When some mines be
 gan to hire scab labor\, the WFM tried to persuade these men to join the u
 nion and strike. When this was unsuccessful\, the union drove the scabs ou
 t of the area with threats and violence.\n\nAfter miners captured and assa
 ulted six deputies\, El Paso County Sheriff M. F. Bowers requested the int
 ervention of the state militia (predecessor to the Colorado National Guard
 ). Finding no apparent disorder on arrival\, the state militia left Crippl
 e Creek on March 20th.\n\nAfter miners rejected an offer of $2.75 a day\, 
 mine owners secretly met with Sheriff Bowers and struck an agreement to fu
 nd a mercenary army of one hundred deputies (later expanded to 1\,200) to 
 police the region.\n\nAs word of the owner's militia spread\, miners began
  to arm themselves. Junius J. Johnson\, a former U.S. Army officer\, was r
 ecruited to take over strike operations. He ordered that fortifications be
  built\, a commissary stocked\, and the miners drilled in maneuvers.\n\nOn
  May 24th\, strikers seized the Strong mine on Battle Mountain\, which ove
 rlooked the town of Victor. The next morning\, 125 deputies arrived in tow
 n. As they marched toward the strikers' camp\, workers at the Strong mine 
 blew up the shafthouse and steam boiler\, showering the deputies with timb
 er\, iron and cable\, causing them to flee the area.\n\nFollowing this inc
 ident\, Governor Davis Waite issued a proclamation demanding that miners d
 isband their fortifications on Bull Hill and declaring that the force of 1
 \,200 deputies was illegal and to be disbanded.\n\nDespite this\, mine own
 ers refused to disband the militia\, which seized the town of Cripple Cree
 k and began imprisoning and brutalizing hundreds of people. Owners only br
 oke up the militia after Cripple Creek was re-captured by state forces and
  Waite threatened to occupy the area for the next thirty days.\n\nThis act
 ion was the only time in U.S. history when a state militia was called out 
 in support of striking workers. Following a June agreement to give workers
  their 8-hour day at a $3.00 wage\, more than 300 union members were arres
 ted on a variety of charges. Only four were convicted\, but they were quic
 kly pardoned by Governor Waite.\n\nThe WFM became popular following the st
 rike's victory and used its success to organize almost every worker in the
  Cripple Creek region\, including waitresses\, laundry workers\, bartender
 s and newsboys\, also helping to elect a new sheriff.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1912\, the city of San Diego banned giving spee
 ches on the street in an attempt to suppress labor organizing efforts by t
 he IWW\, leading to a "Free Speech Fight" involving more than 5\,000 IWW m
 embers.\n\nFree Speech Fights were struggles over free speech involving th
 e Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in the early 20th century\, usuall
 y involving civil disobedience and direct action. The IWW members\, along 
 with other radical labor groups\, were often met with suppression (sometim
 es violent) from local governments and business leaders when trying to giv
 e speeches.\n\nThe San Diego ordinance directly targeted IWW members\, who
 se street "preaching" was explicitly made illegal. The law was met with im
 mediate civil disobedience by labor activists\, and several were immediate
 ly arrested. Over five thousand IWW members came to San Diego to protest t
 he free speech limitation\, and the city's jail capacity was strained.\n\n
 Vigilantes began transporting arrested IWW members to the county border an
 d beating them. One city official who opposed the ordinance was threatened
  with lynching.\n\nPolice indiscriminately used fire hoses on crowds of pr
 otesters\, including women and children. By the fall of 1912\, the protest
  movement petered out and the Free Speech Fight in San Diego was lost.

DESCRIPTION:The Dawes Act\, passed on this day in 1887\, authorized the U.
 S. to divide indigenous tribal land into allotments for heads of families 
 and individuals\, leading to a loss of 2/3rds of land (~100 million acres)
  over the next 50 years.\n\nThe law converted traditional systems of land 
 tenure into a state-imposed system of private property by forcing Native A
 mericans to "assume a capitalist and proprietary relationship with propert
 y" that did not previously exist in their cultures\, according to historia
 n Kent Blansett. The act declared remaining lands after allotment as "surp
 lus" and available for sale\, including to non-Natives.\n\nBetween 1887 an
 d 1934\, indigenous people lost control of about 100 million acres of land
 \, or about two-thirds of the land base they held in 1887\, as a result of
  the act.\n\nThe loss of land and the break-up of traditional leadership o
 f tribes had such devastating consequences that many scholars refer to the
  Dawes Act as one of the most destructive U.S. policies for indigenous peo
 ple in history.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1930\, 50 Vietnamese soldiers of the French col
 onial army mutinied\, attempting to take control of the Yên Bái garrison
  and begin a war of independence against the French. The uprising failed a
 nd many of its leaders were executed.\n\nThe revolt was planned in advance
  by the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (VNQDD)\, a socialist party founded
  by Nguyễn Thái Học (shown) that sought independence from France. The
  VNQDD had previously attempted to engage in clandestine activities to und
 ermine French rule\, but increasing state scrutiny on their activities led
  to their leadership risking a large scale military attack in the Red Rive
 r Delta in northern Vietnam.\n\nMultiple uprisings were planned throughout
  the region\, with VNQDD members taking command of forces with specific st
 rategic missions. The uprisings were supposed to be simultaneous\, but mat
 ters were complicated when a messenger carrying an order from Học to del
 ay the uprising until the 15th was arrested.\n\nEarly in the morning of Fe
 bruary 10th\, 1930\, ~50 Vietnamese soldiers stationed at Yên Bái attack
 ed their 29 French officers\, aided by 60 civilian members of the VNQDD. A
 lthough the French were caught off guard and several officers were killed\
 , the majority of the soldiers present remained loyal to the colonial army
  and helped suppress the uprising. Three Vietnamese sergeants were awarded
  the Médaille militaire for their efforts.\n\nLater than evening\, anothe
 r planned VNQDD revolt in the rural district of Sơn Dương was also supp
 ressed. Although insurgents initially succeeded\, raising the VNQDD flag o
 ver the town\, at sunrise they were routed by the colonial army.\n\nThe Fr
 ench retaliation was swift and brutal. When VNQDD forces fled into the vil
 lage of Co Am\, the French bombed the entire settlement\, killing 200 peop
 le\, mostly civilians. This was the first time that military air power had
  been used in Indochina.\n\nIn France\, the severity of the sentences led 
 to a campaign of solidarity by the French Communist Party and various demo
 nstrations by Vietnamese expatriates. On May 22nd\, 1930\, more than 1\,00
 0 demonstrated outside Élysée Palace against the French reaction to Yên
  Bái. The police arrested 47 people\, deporting 17 back to Vietnam\, wher
 e most of them engaged in communist anti-colonial activities.\n\nIn total\
 , 547 individuals\, both soldiers and civilians\, were prosecuted for thei
 r role in the uprising. Thirty-nine of the surviving leaders of the VNQDD 
 were sentenced to death\, although some of these were later granted clemen
 cy. Học\, along with twelve others\, was guillotined on June 17th\, 1930
 . The thirteen shouted "Vietnam!" in unison before being executed.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1989\, while eating with his family\, Irish cri
 minal defense lawyer Pat Finucane was assassinated by loyalist forces acti
 ng in collusion with the British government. No members of British state s
 ecurity have been prosecuted.\n\nPatrick Finucane was born on March 21st\,
  1949 to a prominent Republican family in Belfast. Three of his brothers w
 ere Irish Republican Army (IRA) members\, two of whom would be imprisoned 
 by the British government.\n\nFinucane himself was a criminal defense lawy
 er. Although he had represented both Republicans and loyalists\, Finucane'
 s most notable client was likely Bobby Sands\, a member of the Provisional
  Irish Republican Army (IRA) who died on hunger strike while imprisoned at
  HM Prison Maze in Northern Ireland.\n\nOn February 12th\, 1989\, while ea
 ting a Sunday meal at home with his wife and three children\, Finucane was
  shot fourteen times by two gunmen. Twelve shots were to his face. The loy
 alist paramilitary Ulster Defence Association took credit for his murder\,
  alleging without evidence that Finucane was a high-ranking member of the 
 IRA.\n\nFollowing a 2001 peace agreement\, the British government promised
  to consider opening an inquiry into Finucane's death\, appointing an inte
 rnational judge to review his case. The government declined to open an inq
 uiry\, however\, after the judge found evidence of state collusion.\n\nIn 
 2004\, Ken Barrett\, a member of the Ulster Defence Association\, pled gui
 lty to Finucane's murder. The identity of the second gunman remains unknow
 n.\n\nIn 2011\, British Prime Minister David Cameron met with Pat Finucane
 's family and admitted to state collusion in his assassination\, but as of
  February 2022 no member of the British security services has been prosecu
 ted.\n\nOn November 30th\, 2020\, Brandon Lewis\, the Northern Ireland Sec
 retary\, rejected calls for a public inquiry into Finucane's killing.

DESCRIPTION:Aung San\, born on this day in 1915\, was a Burmese revolution
 ary nationalist who was instrumental in helping Burma achieve independence
  from British imperialists\, however he was assassinated six months before
  independence was formalized.\n\nAung San was born to a family distinguish
 ed in the resistance movement after the British annexation of 1886. He enr
 olled in Rangoon University in 1933 and became secretary of the university
 's student union and and editor of its newspaper.\n\nIn 1936\, Aung San wa
 s expelled for refusing to reveal the name of an author for the paper who 
 had criticized a university official. In response\, students went on strik
 e\, leading to his reinstatement. The incident garnered nationwide publici
 ty and recognition for Aung San.\n\nIn 1938\, Aung San joined the Thakins\
 , a movement of nationalist intellectuals who rejected British rule. In 19
 39\, he became a founding member and the first Secretary-General of the Co
 mmunist Party of Burma\, however he had a unsteady relationship with the P
 arty\, joining and leaving it twice.\n\nIn 1940\, Aung San was contacted b
 y Japanese agents\, who offered assistance to help him raise an army to fi
 ght against British rule. On December 28th\, 1941\, Aung San\, as part of 
 the "Thirty Comrades"\, formally inaugurated the Burma Independence Army (
 BIA) in Bangkok.\n\nThe BIA initially collaborated with Japanese forces fo
 llowing their invasion of the country in 1942 and establishment of a puppe
 t government. However\, relations between the BIA and Japan soon deteriora
 ted\, and Aung San grew suspicious of Japan's true intentions in the regio
 n.\n\nAung San began to secretly organize against the Japanese occupation\
 , founding the "Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League" (AFPL) in 1944. On M
 arch 27th\, 1945\, Aung San led a surprise attack against Japanese forces\
 , continuing to fight them for the remainder of World War II.\n\nFollowing
  the end of war and official alignment with Allied forces\, British forces
  sought to integrate the Burma National Army into the colonial armed force
 s. Aung San\, who was not personally invited to negotiate by the British\,
  reorganized former soldiers as the paramilitary "People's Volunteer Organ
 ization" in an attempt to preserve an armed\, nationalist formation.\n\nCl
 ement Attlee's newly-elected Labour Party government in the United Kingdom
  decided to start moving towards a withdrawal\, and\, beginning in Septemb
 er 1946\, Aung San served as Premier of the Crown Colony of Burma\, a move
  criticized by the Communist Party. On January 27th\, 1947\, Aung and Attl
 ee signed an agreement on the terms of independence within the year.\n\nOn
  July 19th\, before the transition to independence had been completed\, Au
 ng San was assassinated along with seven other members of the interim gove
 rnment under unclear circumstances.\n\nU Saw\, a political rival\, was lat
 er executed for his role in the killings\, although there have been allega
 tions made regarding British complicity in the incident.\n\n"If you're fee
 ling helpless\, help someone."\n\n- Aung San

  known when Slim became a Wobbly\, a member of the Industrial Workers of t

 ion of the IWW Songbook.\n\nSlim became one of the IWW's most famous write
 rs during the 1920s and 30s\, and many people would buy the "Industrial Wo
 rker" just to read his articles - one ad from the paper read "there's a lo
 t more in Industrial Solidarity and Industrial Worker than T-Bone Slim's c
 olumns".\n\nSlim did not presume his working-class readership to be uninte
 lligent people\, making use of complex wordplay and experimental writing t
 echniques\, playing with ambiguity\, satire and surrealism.\n\nSlim was al
 so well-known for his songs\, such as the "Lumberjack's Prayer"\, a parody
  of the Lord's Prayer about the poor quality of food available for the wor
 king class\, and "The Popular Wobbly"\, which experienced a revival among 
 civil rights activists during the 1960s.\n\nIn spite of his renown in radi

 ar. During the mid-1930s\, he settled in New York City\, where he worked a
 s a barge captain on the docks.\n\nIn May 1942\, Slim's body was found in 
 the East River. His cause of death remains unknown and has been subject to
  speculation. Following his death\, Slim largely faded into obscurity\, es
 pecially compared to more famous IWW-associated writers such as Joe Hill.\
 n\nSlim's songs have been preserved\, however\, re-published in editions o
 f the Little Red Songbook and covered by musicians such as Pete Seeger\, U

 letter:\n\n"Our Vietnam people\, as early as 1941\, stood by the Allies' s
 ide and fought against the Japanese and their associates\, the French colo
 nialists. From 1941 to 1945 we fought bitterly\, sustained by the patrioti
 sm of our fellow-countrymen and by the promises made by the Allies at [the
  summits in] Yalta\, San Francisco and Potsdam.\n\n...The French aggressio
 n on a peace-loving people is a direct menace to world security. It implie
 s the complicity\, or at least\, the connivance of the Great Democracies. 
 The United Nations ought to keep their words. They ought to interfere to s
 top this unjust war\, and to show that they mean to carry out in peace-tim
 e the principles for which they fought in war-time.\n\n...It is with this 
 firm conviction that we request of the United States as guardians and cham
 pions of World Justice to take a decisive step in support of our independe
 nce. What we ask has been graciously granted to the Philippines. Like the 
 Philippines our goal is full independence and full cooperation with the Un

DESCRIPTION:Audre Lorde\, born on this day in 1934\, was a queer feminist 
 author and socialist activist. Among her works are "The Black Unicorn" and
  "Your Silence Will Not Protect You: Essays and Poems".\n\nLorde was born 
 in New York City to Caribbean immigrants - a father from Barbados and Gren
 adian mother. She took an interest in poetry and reading at an early age\;
  when asked how she was feeling\, Lorde would often respond by reciting a 
 memorized poem.\n\nLorde attended Hunter College in New York\, graduating 
 in 1959. While there\, she worked as a librarian and became an active part
 icipant in the gay culture of Greenwich Village.\n\nIn 1961\, Lorde earned
  a master's degree in library science from Columbia University. During thi
 s period\, she worked as a public librarian in nearby Mount Vernon\, New Y
 ork\, authored poetry\, and participated in civil rights demonstrations.\n
 \nIn 1984\, Lorde started a visiting professorship in West Berlin at the F
 ree University of Berlin. During her time in Germany\, Lorde became an inf
 luential part of the nascent Afro-German movement. Together with a group o
 f black women activists in Berlin\, Audre Lorde coined the term "Afro-Germ
 an" and became a mentor to a number of women\, including May Ayim\, Ika H
 ügel-Marshall\, and Helga Emde.\n\nLorde's thinking was emphatically inte
 rsectional\, criticizing\, in her words\, "racism\, the belief in the inhe
 rent superiority of one race over all others and thereby the right to domi
 nance. Sexism\, the belief in the inherent superiority of one sex over the
  other and thereby the right to dominance. Ageism. Heterosexism. Elitism. 
 Classism."\n\nOf non-intersectional feminism in the U.S.\, Lorde famously 
 said "Those of us who stand outside the circle of this society's definitio
 n of acceptable women\; those of us who have been forged in the crucibles 
 of difference -- those of us who are poor\, who are lesbians\, who are Bla
 ck\, who are older -- know that survival is not an academic skill. It is l
 earning how to take our differences and make them strengths. For the maste
 r's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us tempo
 rarily to beat him at his own game\, but they will never enable us to brin
 g about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women w
 ho still define the master's house as their only source of support."\n\n"W
 ithout community\, there is no liberation."\n\n- Audre lorde

 e Mystique was the number one non-fiction book in the U.S.\, selling over 
 a million copies. The phrase "feminine mystique" was created by Friedan to
  illustrate the assumptions that women would be fulfilled from their house
 work\, marriage\, sexual lives\, and children. Friedan sought to prove tha
 t housewives were unsatisfied but could not voice their feelings.\n\nDespi
 te the importance of the book in feminist history\, it has faced numerous 
 criticisms. According to Kirsten Fermaglich and Lisa Fine\, "women of colo

  were completely absent from Friedan's vision\, as were white working-clas

  killed several bystanders with trolleys. Approximately ten strikers and b

 trike until April 19th. After nine weeks of the strike\, costing RTC $2\,3
 95\,000 and the city government millions\, RTC agreed to a wage increase\,
  the re-hiring of strikers within three months\, and mediation of the init

DESCRIPTION:Claudia Jones\, born on this day in 1915\, was a communist aut
 hor\, activist\, and journalist active in the United States and Great Brit
 ain. She was imprisoned and deported by the U.S. for violating the anti-co
 mmunist McCarran and Smith Acts.\n\nBorn in the British colony of Trinidad
  as Claudia Vera Cumberbatch\, she later adopted the name Jones as "self-p
 rotective disinformation". She came to the U.S. as a child when her family
  migrated to Harlem.\n\nGrowing up working poor had a lasting impact on Jo
 nes\; her mother died when she was twelve from work-related exhaustion and
  she herself caught tuberculosis at the age of 17 from poor living conditi
 ons\, leading to lifelong lung damage.\n\nIn 1936\, Jones joined the Young
  Communist League USA to help support the Scottsboro Boys\, a group of you
 ng black men being subjected to a legalized form of lynching in the Americ
 an South. Jones became a prominent author within the organization\, editin
 g its monthly journal "Spotlight".\n\nAs a member of the Communist Party U
 SA and a feminist black nationalist\, Jones' main focus was on creating "a
 n anti-imperialist coalition\, managed by working-class leadership\, fuele
 d by the involvement of women"\, and championed women's causes inside the 
 Party.\n\nOne of Jones' best known works is the 1949 piece "An End to the 
 Neglect of the Problems of the Negro Woman!". In the work\, Jones shows an
  understanding of what would later be called "intersectionality"\, writing
 : "The bourgeoisie is fearful of the militancy of the Negro woman\, and fo
 r good reason. The capitalists know\, far better than many progressives se
 em to know\, that once Negro women begin to take action\, the militancy of
  the whole Negro people\, and thus of the anti-imperialist coalition\, is 
 greatly enhanced."\n\nFollowing a hearing by the Immigration and Naturaliz
 ation Service\, Jones was found in violation of the McCarran Act for being
  an "alien" (a non-citizen) who had joined the Communist Party\, despite t
 he fact that she had identified herself as a party member when completing 
 her Alien Registration in 1940. She was ordered to be deported in 1950.\n\
 nBefore Jones could be deported\, however\, she was tried and convicted wi
 th eleven others\, including her friend and communist of note Elizabeth Gu
 rley Flynn\, of "un-American activities" under the anti-communist Smith Ac
 t.\n\nAfter serving several years in prison\, Jones was released in 1955 a
 nd deported to the United Kingdom on December 7th that year. She immediate
 ly joined the Communist Party of Great Britain upon her arrival in Britain
  and remained a member until her death.\n\nJones continued her activism in
  Britain\, campaigning against racism and sexism\, speaking at trade union
  rallies\, and visiting China\, meeting with Mao Zedong. In 1958\, Jones f
 ounded the West Indian Gazette\, Britain's first major black newspaper\, a
 nd helped organize celebrations of Caribbean culture that became the annua
 l Notting Hill Carnival.\n\nJones died in 1964 at the age of 49. She is bu
 ried next to Karl Marx in Highgate Cemetery\, North London.\n\n"It was out
  of my Jim Crow experiences as a young negro woman\, experiences likewise 
 born of working-class poverty that led me to join the Young Communist Leag
 ue and to choose the philosophy of my life\, the science of Marxism-Lenini
 sm - that philosophy not only rejects racist ideas\, but is the antithesis
  of them."\n\n- Claudia Jones

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1919\, social democratic revolutionary Kurt Eis
 ner was assassinated by a far-right nationalist while leading the People's
  State of Bavaria. Eisner became a martyr and a Bavarian Soviet Republic w
 as declared just a few months later.\n\nKurt Eisner\, born to a Jewish fam

 , and theater critic. Before leading the People's State of Bavaria\, he wo
 rked as a journalist in Marburg\, Nuremberg\, and Munich. In the early 189
 0s\, Eisner served nine months in prison for writing an article that attac
 ked Kaiser Wilhelm II.\n\nIn 1918\, Eisner was convicted of treason for hi
 s role in inciting a strike of munitions workers. He spent nine months in 
 Cell 70 of Stadelheim Prison\, but was released during the General Amnesty
  in October of that year.\n\nFollowing his release from prison\, Eisner he
 lped organize the revolution that overthrew the Bavarian monarchy\, declar
 ing Bavaria to be a free state and republic. Despite Eisner's socialist po
 litics\, he explicitly distanced the movement from the Bolsheviks and prom
 ised to uphold property rights.\n\nOn February 21st\, 1919\, while on his 
 way to deliver his resignation to Parliament\, Eisner was assassinated in 
 Munich by a far-right German nationalist. Eisner's murder made him a marty

 , would go on to become powerful figures in the Nazi Party. Ironically\, A
 dolf Hitler himself marched in the funeral procession for Eisner\, a Jew\,
  wearing a red armband as a display of sympathy.\n\n"Truth is the greatest
  of all national possessions. A state\, a people\, a system which suppress

COMMENT:On this day in 1965\, before addressing the Organization of Afro-A
 merican Unity in Manhattan\, Malcolm X was assassinated by 3 gunmen. 2 of 
 the men convicted were later exonerated and the 3rd had met with an ex-FBI
  agent the night before.
DESCRIPTION:Malcolm X was a Muslim minister and human rights activist who 
 was assassinated on this day in 1965. He is best known for militant advoca
 cy of black liberation and time spent as a vocal spokesman for the Nation 
 of Islam.\n\nMalcolm's policy of endorsing violent self-defense (i.e.\, ac
 hieving liberation "by any means necessary") and opposition to integration
  stood in stark contrast to his contemporary Martin Luther King Jr.\, whom
  Malcolm referred to as a "chump".\n\nOn this day in 1965\, he was prepari
 ng to address the Organization of Afro-American Unity in Manhattan's Audub
 on Ballroom when a quarrel broke out. A man rushed forward and shot him on
 ce in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun and two other men charged the sta
 ge firing semi-automatic handguns.\n\nMalcolm X was pronounced dead at 3:3
 0 pm\, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The gunme
 n\, identified as members of Nation of Islam\, were convicted of murder an
 d sentenced to life in prison. Two of these men were exonerated on Novembe
 r 18th\, 2021.\n\nDespite the conviction of these three men\, allegations 
 of conspiracy surround Malcolm's death\, including the complicity of the N
 ew York Police Department and involvement of Louis Farrakhan\, a leader wi
 thin the Nation of Islam at the time of Malcolm's death.\n\nEarl Grant\, o
 ne of Malcolm X's associates who was present at the assassination\, wrote:
  "About five minutes later\, a most incredible scene took place. Into the 
 hall sauntered about a dozen policemen. They were strolling at about the p
 ace one would expect of them if they were patrolling a quiet park...Here w
 ere New York City policemen\, entering a room from which at least a dozen 
 shots had been heard\, and yet not one of them had his gun out!...some of 
 them even had their hands in their pockets.\n\nJournalist Louis Lomax wrot
 e that John Ali\, national secretary of the Nation of Islam\, was a former
  FBI agent. Malcolm X had confided to a reporter that Ali was his "archene
 my" within the Nation of Islam leadership. Lomax notes that Ali had a meet
 ing with Talmadge Hayer\, one of the men convicted of killing Malcolm and 
 the only one not exonerated later\, the night before the assassination.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Nina Simone\, born on this day in 1933\, was an American singe

 as "Mississippi Goddam" and "Four Women".\n\nSimone was born Eunice Kathle
 en Waymon to a working class family in Tryon\, North Carolina on February 
 21st\, 1933. Showing prodigious musical talent at a young age\, at twelve 
 years old\, she refused to perform at her first classical recital until he
 r parents were allowed to sit in the front of the recital hall.\n\nThrough
 out the 1950s\, 60s\, and 70s\, Simone made a living as musician and singe
 r in the U.S.\, teaching\, playing\, and singing. Although Simone was and 
 is often categorized as a jazz musician\, she dismissed the term\, saying 
 "To most white people\, jazz means black and jazz means dirt\, and that's 
 not what I play. I play black classical music."\n\nFollowing the white sup
 remacist murders of Medgar Evers and four young black girls in the Birming
 ham Church Bombing of 1963\, she released "Nina Simone in Concert"\, an al
 bum which contained the song "Mississippi Goddam"\, raging explicitly agai
 nst racism in the U.S.\n\nMississippi Goddam\, which Simone stated was "li
 ke throwing ten bullets back at them"\, was boycotted in some southern reg
 ions\, and copies of the album were smashed and mailed back to her record 
 distributor. Undeterred\, Simone continued to be overtly political in her 
 music\, authoring "Old Jim Crow" and performing songs such as "Strange Fru
 it" and "Backlash Blues"\, written by Langston Hughes.\n\nSimone left the 
 U.S. for Barbados in September 1970\, living in London and the Netherlands
  before finally settling in France. In 2003\, she passed away in Carry-le-
 Rouet.\n\n"It was always Marx\, Lenin\, and revolution - real girl's talk.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1848\, the French February Revolution began whe

 ion\, leading to the founding of the Second Republic and establishment of 
 labor reforms. Among the reforms the Second Republic passed were universal
  male suffrage and a guaranteed "right to work"\, provided by National Wor
 kshops which gave the unemployed with a source of income.\n\nThe protests 
 of February 22nd were triggered by the banning of political banquets\, leg
 al means of criticizing the government and fundraising for political organ
 izing. Incidentally\, communist journalist Friedrich Engels was in Paris a
 t the time and witnessed these banquets. After the ban\, thousands flooded
  out onto the streets to protest against the "Citizen King" Louis Philippe
  and his chief minister François Pierre Guillaume Guizot.\n\nShouting "Do
 wn with Guizot" and "Long Live the Reform"\, the crowds marched past Guizo
 t's residence and erected barricades in the streets of Paris\, where fight
 ing broke out between the citizens and the Parisian municipal guards. Fren
 ch troops shot into the crowd\, killing at least fifty-two people.\n\nIn t
 he next few days\, Guizot resigned and King Philippe fled the country. By 
 February 26th\, the Second Republic had been formed\, with poet Alphonse d
 e Lamartine acting as a de facto dictator over France for the next three m
 onths.\n\nThe Second Republic's governance would be tested in the "June Da
 ys" uprising\, which Karl Marx identified as a conflict between petite bou
 rgeoisie and the proletariat. The revolting workers were crushed by force 
 (with over 4\,000 insurgents being deported to Algeria) and the Second Rep

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1834\, six workers in the English village of To
 lpuddle were arrested and sentenced to penal labor in Australia after form
 ing a union. Their case became a cause célèbre for the working class\, a
 nd the men were pardoned.\n\nThe "Tolpuddle Martyrs" - George and James Lo
 veless\; James Hammett\; James Brine\; Thomas and John Standfield - had pr
 eviously formed the "Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers" to organi
 ze around their shared interest as farm workers. Their arrests took place 
 in the context of a crackdown on protest and worker agitation by the Briti
 sh ruling class\, following the Swing Riots of 1830.\n\nThe six men were c
 harged with "taking an illegal oath" under the Mutiny Act of 1797\, as the
 y had sworn each other to secrecy in order to avoid repression by authorit
 ies. The prosecution was driven by their boss\, local landowner James Fram
 pton\, who also sat on the jury during their trial.\n\nAll six men were se
 ntenced to seven years in Australia in March 1834\, sparking outcry from t
 he labor movement. On April 21st\, 1834\, 30\,000 people gathered in moder
 n day King's Cross to present an 800\,000-strong petition on the men's beh
 alf. Home Secretary Lord Melbourne avoided workers by hiding behind a set 
 of curtains.\n\nAfter the government attempted to provide conditional pard
 ons in June 1835\, the unions continued to push further\, compelling the s
 tate to give full\, unconditional pardons to all six men on March 14th\, 1
 836. The men finally returned home from Australia between 1837 and 1839.\n
 \nThe case of the Tolpuddle Martyrs became an important milestone and a su
 ccess for the early English worker movement. Today\, this working class vi
 ctory is commemorated with a museum and annual July festival in the villag
 e of Tolpuddle.

 The strike spread rapidly\, quickly bringing the city to a halt\, and reac

 strike.\n\nWhile the Nazis were initially caught off-guard\, they quickly 
 mobilized to crush the strike before it could develop into a wider revolt.
  Nazi authorities violently broke up the protests\, killing nine people an
 d bringing the general strike to an end after two days.\n\nAccording to au

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1986\, U.S.-backed Filipino dictator Ferdinand 
 Marcos fled the country after days of millions protesting in the streets f
 ollowing rigged elections. The uprising is known as the EDSA\, People Powe
 r\, or Yellow Revolution.\n\nFerdinand Marcos had initially assumed power 
 through a popular election in 1965. However\, in 1972 he declared martial 
 law during his second term\, citing the threat posed by the Communist Part
 y of the Philippines (CPP) and other rebel groups\, effectively gaining di
 ctatorial powers.\n\nMarcos and his allies embezzled billions of dollars i
 n state assets while the government persecuted and killed dissidents throu
 ghout the 1970s and early 80s\, enjoying support from the U.S. In 1981\, t
 hen Vice President George Bush commended Marcos for his "adherence to demo
 cratic principles".\n\nIn 1983\, exiled opposition leader Benigno "Ninoy" 
 Aquino attempted to returned to the country\, but was assassinated after l
 anding at Manila International Airport. The shock of this event\, alongsid
 e an economic crisis\, compounded public anger\, and civil resistance grew
  significantly in the following years.\n\nIn response to this pressure\, M
 arcos announced that a snap presidential election would take place in Febr
 uary 1986. Ninoy Aquino's widow Corazon served as the main opposition cand
 idate.\n\nOfficial results from the election saw a victory for Marcos\, bu
 t the vote saw widespread instances of fraud and intimidation\, resulting 
 in a walkout of workers at the national election monitor and a condemnatio
 n from the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines.\n\nBoth candid
 ates claimed victory\, and Aquino called for civil disobedience and boycot
 t of media and companies which supported Marcos. The "Reform the Armed For
 ces Movement"\, a group of dissenting military officers\, plotted a coup\,
  but were arrested by authorities.\n\nOn February 22nd\, the Archbishop of
  Manila urged civilians via the Catholic radio station Radio Veritas to ga
 ther on a stretch of the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue\, (commonly known a
 s "EDSA") in order to help to supply and support rebel officers.\n\nOver t
 he next few days\, crowds ballooned\, with approximately 2 million partici
 pating in total. Marcos ultimately backed down from using lethal force to 
 disperse the crowds\, and\, faced with growing military defections\, fled 
 the country on February 25th\, 1986. Corazon Aquino was inaugurated Presid
 ent the same day.\n\nAlthough Marcos' dictatorship was brought to an end a
 nd the Philippines has maintained liberal rule as the Fifth Philippine Rep
 ublic\, extrajudicial killings and rampant corruption continued through Aq
 uino's rule and beyond. Less than a year later\, 12 people were killed by 
 state forces in the Mendiola Massacre\, when police fired on a farmers' ma
 rch in Manila.\n\nResearcher Mark John Sanchez writes: "In the years since
  1986\, the legacy of the People Power Revolution has remained uncertain..
 .The agricultural and economic reform that many Filipinos hoped for in a p
 ost-Marcos world did not come. Peace talks with the Communist Party of the
  Philippines dissolved and leftists continued to be maligned\, attacked\, 
 and hunted."

DESCRIPTION:"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences" was an anti-
 Stalin speech delivered by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to the 20th Con
 gress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on this day in 1956.\n\nK
 hrushchev's speech was sharply critical of the reign of the deceased Josep
 h Stalin\, particularly with respect to the purges which took place in the
  1930s. The U.S. State Department received a copy of the speech from East 
 European sources and quickly released it.\n\nThe speech marked a decisive 
 turning point in not just Soviet history\, but international communist his
 tory more broadly. It led\, in part\, to the Sino-Soviet Split (deteriorat
 ion of relations between the USSR and communist China) and was an importan
 t milestone in the so-called "Khrushchev Thaw"\, a liberalization of socia
 l policies in the USSR.\n\nKhrushchev's denunciation of Stalin caused poli
 tical turmoil throughout the international communist movement. Historian L
 ewis Siegelbaum notes that\, in Tbilisi\, Georgia\, students demonstrated 
 against the removal of a monument to Stalin\, while in Poland\, demonstrat
 ions by workers in Poznan over declining wages and deep divisions between 
 recalcitrant Stalinists and anti-Stalinists within the Polish Workers’ P
 arty threatened to engulf the country in crisis. In the West\, the Communi
 st Party USA alone lost more than 30\,000 members within weeks of its publ

 s fired for striking\, even if the strike was triggered by that employer's
  illegal actions. The case is known as National Labor Relations Board v. F
 ansteel Metallurgical Corporation.\n\nIn the late 1930s\, sit-down strikes
  had become prevalent in the auto industry and were particularly effective
  at winning worker demands. In a sit-down strike\, workers stay by their s
 tation in the factory but refuse to work it. Factory management was usuall
 y reluctant to try and force workers out of the factory for fear of damagi
 ng expensive machinery\, and often capitulated to them.\n\nOn February 17t
 h\, 1937\, workers frustrated by failed attempts at getting Fansteel to re
 cognize their union announced a sit-down strike and seized a portion of th
 eir factory. The employer won an injunction ordering the union men to vaca
 te the premises\, which they ignored\, but were ultimately forced out.\n\n
 The NLRB held on March 14th\, 1938\, that Fansteel had to reinstate 90 of 
 the workers because the company had violated the law first (precipitating 
 the sit-down strike). Fansteel sued the government in response and won in 
 the Supreme Court case NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp (1939).

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1933\, the Reichstag was burned. Nazis blamed t
 he arson on communists and arrested them en masse. Dutch communist Marinus
  van der Lubbe was executed for the act\, but some historians believe the 
 burning may have been a false flag by the Nazis in order to consolidate th
 eir power.\n\nThe first report of the fire came shortly after 9:00 pm on F
 ebruary 27th\, 1933. The police conducted a thorough search inside the bui
 lding and found Van der Lubbe\, who was arrested.\n\nOn February 28th\, Pr
 esident Paul von Hindenburg issued the "Reichstag Fire Decree"\, suspendin
 g civil liberties and beginning a widespread crackdown on communists. The 
 Nazi-controlled police arrested leftists en masse\, including all of the c
 ommunist Reichstag delegates\, severely crippling their participation in t
 he elections the following week.\n\nVan Der Lubbe\, and four communist lea
 ders were tried in the Leipzig Trial in September 1933. All except Van der
  Lubbe were acquitted\, and the Dutch council communist was executed at th
 e age of 24.\n\nAt the same time Nazis were using the fire as a pretext to
  suppress their political opponents\, communists internationally were accu
 sing Nazis of organizing the fire as a false flag operation. Historians re
 main divided on the issue\, with some concluding that van der Lubbe acting
  alone and others believing that Nazis were responsible for the arson.\n\n
 In July 2019\, more than 80 years after the fire\, an affidavit from Hans-
 Martin Lennings\, a former member of a Nazi paramilitary\, was discovered.
  The document stated that\, the night of the fire\, his unit had driven Va
 n der Lubbe from an infirmary to the Reichstag and that the fire was ongoi
 ng when they arrived\, indicating Van der Lubbe's innocence and possible N
 azi complicity.\n\nIn any case\, the Reichstag Fire proved a pivotal event
  in the establishment of Nazi Germany\, with Nazis winning the subsequent 
 March elections after imprisoning and terrorizing their left opposition. T
 he Reichstag Fire Decree paved the way for Nazi dictatorship\, according t
 o the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

  town of Wounded Knee\, South Dakota\, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservatio

  of the area were apprehended at gunpoint and taken hostage.\n\nThe town w
 as promptly surrounded by an army of U.S. personnel. John Sayer\, author o
 f "Ghost Dancing the Law: The Wounded Knee Trials"\, wrote - "The equipmen
 t maintained by the military while in use during the siege included fiftee
 n armored personnel carriers\, clothing\, rifles\, grenade launchers\, fla
 res\, and 133\,000 rounds of ammunition\, for a total cost\, including the
  use of maintenance personnel from the National Guard of five states and p
 ilot and planes for aerial photographs\, of over half a million dollars."\
 n\nAlthough the Department of Justice (DoJ) prohibited media from the site
 \, the occupation received support from the Congressional Black Caucus and
  prominent public figures\, including Marlon Brando\, Johnny Cash\, Angela
  Davis\, and Jane Fonda. Angela Davis was turned away by federal forces as
  an "undesirable person" when she attempted to enter Wounded Knee in March
  1973.\n\nMarlon Brando asked Sacheen Littlefeather\, President of the Nat

 aditional Apache clothing and stated that Brando declined the award due to
  "the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry...and on te
 levision and movie reruns and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee"
 .\n\nTribal leaders called off the occupation after 71 days after the kill
 ing of Lawrence "Buddy" Lamont\, a local Oglala man\, by U.S. sniper fire.
  The terms of ending the occupation included a mandated meeting at Chief F
 ools Crow's land to discuss reinstating the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie\, 
 which stated that the Black Hills of South Dakota belonged to the Sioux pe
 ople.\n\nIn the 1980 Supreme Court case United States v. Sioux Nation of I

 valued at $1.3 billion as of 2011.\n\n"If we accept the money\, then we ha

 as the "White Terror".
DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1947\, the 228 Massacre took place in Taiwan wh
 en anti-government protesters in Taipei were fired on by the army\, killin
 g three people. The murders began a period of open rebellion and 38 years 
 of martial law known as the "White Terror".\n\nThe incident took place in 
 the wake of drastic political changes following World War II. After the su
 rrender of Japan\, the Allies handed administrative control of Taiwan to t
 he Republic of China (ROC\, not to be confused with the People's Republic 
 of China\, PRC)\, thus ending 50 years of Japanese colonial rule. The ROC'
 s rule was resented by the local population\, characterized by massive pri
 ce inflation and corruption.\n\nOn February 27th\, 1947\, state agents con
 fiscated contraband cigarettes from a 40-year-old widow named Lin Jiang-ma
 i (林江邁). When she demanded their return\, one of the men struck her 
 in the head with the butt of his gun\, prompting the surrounding Taiwanese
  crowd to challenge the agents. As they fled\, one agent shot his gun into
  the crowd\, killing a bystander.\n\nThe next morning\, protesters gathere
 d around Taipei\, calling for the arrest and trial of the agents involved 
 in the shooting. Soldiers opened fire into the crowd\, killing at least th
 ree people.\n\nFormosans (Taiwanese people) took over the administration o
 f the town and military bases on March 4th\, and forced their way into loc
 al radio station to broadcast news of the incident and calling for people 
 to revolt\, causing uprisings to erupt throughout the island.\n\nBy evenin
 g\, martial law had been declared\, and curfews were enforced by the arres
 t or shooting of anyone who violated curfew. Reinforcements from the Natio
 nalist Government\, led by Chen Yi\, arrived on March 8th and initiated a 
 brutal campaign of suppression.\n\nOne American eyewitness was cited by th
 e New York Times: "[ROC troops] indulged in three days of indiscriminate k
 illing and looting...In the poorer sections the streets were said to have 
 been littered with dead. There were instances of beheadings and mutilation
  of bodies\, and women were raped\, the American said."\n\nThe initial 228
  Massacre was followed by 38 years of martial law\, commonly referred to a
 s the "White Terror"\, lasting until the end of 1987\, during which period
  over a 100\,000 people were imprisoned for political reasons and more tha
 n 1\,000 were executed. Discussion of the 228 Massacre was prohibited.\n\n
 Since the end of martial law\, the government has set up the 228 Incident 
 Memorial Foundation\, a civilian reparations fund supported by public dona
 tions for the victims and their families. Today\, February 28th is an offi
 cial public holiday called "Peace Memorial Day"\, on which the president o
 f Taiwan gathers with other officials to ring a commemorative bell in memo
 ry of the victims.

 wntown San Salvador to protest the electoral fraud. Security forces arrive

 underreported by the New York Times\, which reported on March 1st\, 1977 t
 hat only six people had been killed. President Molina blamed the protests 
 on "foreign Communists" and immediately exiled a number of top UNO party m
 embers from the country.\n\nOne of the consequences of the massacre was th

  of the Socialist Party of America and the first socialist member of the H

 to the United States as a young man and became an influential journalist i
 n Wisconsin\, helping establish the "Sewer Socialist" movement. In 1910\, 
 he was elected as the first socialist to the U.S. House of Representatives
 \, representing a district in Milwaukee\, Wisconsin.\n\nBerger was a white
  supremacist\, defending segregation on the grounds that "negroes and mula
 ttoes constitute a lower race - that the Caucasian and even the Mongolian 
 have the start on them in civilization by many years."\n\nHistorian Sally 
 Miller notes that Berger also drafted an unsuccessful resolution to ban As
 ian immigrants from the Socialist Party\, stating "If we admit the Chinese
 \, the Japanese\, and the Korean...it will be clear to America's workingme
 n that the party does not want to help them".\n\nIn 1919\, Berger was conv
 icted of violating the Espionage Act for publicizing his anti-intervention
 ist views surrounding World War I. As a result\, he was denied his seat in
  the House of Representatives. The verdict was eventually overturned by th
 e Supreme Court in 1921\, and Berger was elected to three successive terms
  in the 1920s.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1921\, ~15\,000 people assembled in Kronstadt\,
  demanding election reforms\, an end to censorship\, and the allowance of 
 individual production\, marking the beginning of the Kronstadt Rebellion a
 gainst the nascent Bolshevik government.\n\nThe uprising consisted of sail
 ors\, soldiers\, and civilians from a variety of political persuasions\, i
 ncluding anti-communist reactionaries and anarchists. The uprising was als
 o the last major revolt against the Bolsheviks on Russian territory during
  the civil war.\n\nThe Kronstadt Rebellion took place in the context of a 
 difficult winter in which fuel and food became scarce. Protests and civil 
 unrest were happening throughout Russia\, and sailors in Kronstadt had dep
 osed their commander Raskolnikov in weeks earlier\, in late January.\n\nOn
  February 28th\, in reaction to government suppression of protests in Petr
 ograd\, the sailors drafted a set of fifteen demands\, including free elec
 tions\, freedom of assembly for peasant and labor organizations\, to aboli
 sh the Bolshevik fighting detachments in all army branches\, and to allow 
 peasants full control of their land\, provided they don't employ others.\n
 \nOn March 2nd\, a Provisional Revolutionary Committee was formed\, demand
 ing a "third revolution" to restore the revolutionary values Kronstadt sup
 porters felt the Bolsheviks had betrayed. The Bolsheviks accused Kronstadt
  rebels of being counter-revolutionary and petty bourgeois in character\, 
 moving to crush the rebellion by force.\n\nOn March 7th\, the Red Army beg
 an attacking the island with small land forces and aerial bombardment\, ho
 wever little progress was made at first. On March 16th\, a Bolshevik force
  of 50\,000 met and defeated the 15\,000 rebels\, seizing control of the i
 sland.\n\n8\,000 Kronstadt refugees crossed into Finland within a day of K
 ronstadt's fall\, sabotaging the defenses as they left. Casualty estimates
  vary widely\, but thousands of soldiers were killed on either side.\n\nTh
 e political character of the uprising is seriously contested\, and the ins
 urrection has been memorialized by critics of the Soviet Union\, from figu
 res such as anarchist Emma Goldman to Boris Yeltsin\, the corrupt\, anti-c
 ommunist first President of the Russian Federation. In 1994\, Yeltsin reha
 bilitated the rebels and created a memorial for them in Kronstadt.\n\nAnar
 chists tend to view the Kronstadt Rebellion as a righteous uprising agains
 t an increasingly repressive Soviet state\, while Marxist-Leninists genera
 lly regard it as counter-revolutionary and petty bourgeois in character.\n
 \nFor his part\, Vladimir Lenin regarded the episode as a critical challen
 ge to the revolution\, calling Kronstadt "undoubtedly more dangerous than 
 Denikin\, Yudenich\, and Kolchak combined".\n\nIn 1970\, anarchist histori
 an Paul Avrich published a seminal and thorough history of the uprising in
  English\, titled "Kronstadt\, 1921".

 Colvin's arrest was not peaceful - Claudette was forcibly removed from the

 with disturbing the peace\, violating segregation laws\, and battering and

 dn't have a chance." Of Parks\, Colvin said "Her skin texture was the kind
  that people associate with the middle class. She fit that profile."\n\nCo
 lvin was one of four women plaintiffs in Browder v. Gayle\, the court case
  that successfully overturned bus segregation laws in Alabama.\n\nColvin l
 eft Montgomery for New York City in 1958 because she had difficulty findin

 us segregation (similarly\, Rosa Parks left Montgomery for Detroit in 1957
 ). Colvin stated she was branded a troublemaker by many in her community. 
 She withdrew from college and went on to become a nurse in Manhattan.\n\nO
 n her act of defiance that day\, Colvin stated "History kept me stuck to m

  among them actor Marlon Brando and Puyallup tribal leader Bob Satiacum\, 
 illegally fished in the Puyallup River to protest the denial of treaty rig
 hts to Native Americans. This form of civil disobedience is known as a "fi
 sh-in"\, and in this specific incident both Brando and an Episcopal clergy
 man were arrested.\n\nThe fish-in was staged by the National Indian Youth 
 Council\, a Native American civil rights organization formed in Gallup\, N
 ew Mexico in 1961. It became part of the so-called "Fish Wars"\, a set of 
 protests spanning decades in which Native American tribes around the Puget
  Sound pressured the U.S. government to recognize fishing rights granted b
 y the Point No Point Treaty.\n\nThe protests eventually won indigenous peo
 ple in the area the right to fish without state permits - in the 1974 case
  "United States v. Washington"\, U.S. District Court Judge George Hugo Bol
 dt stated that treaty right fishermen must be allowed to take up to 50% of
  all potential fishing harvests and required that they have an equal voice
  in the management of the fishery.\n\nThe so-called "Boldt Decision" was r
 eaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 1979 and has been used as a precedent fo
 r handling other\, similar treaties.

 Their partnership was marked by a shared commitment to progressive and ant
 i-colonial causes.\n\nDuring Messali's long spells in prison\, Émilie oft
 en spoke on his behalf and used her position as a French woman to criticiz
 e France's commitment to "civilising" Algeria. She is sometimes credited w
 ith creating the first Algerian flag\, however this story is considered ap
 ocryphal or exaggerated by some historians.\n\nBusquant died in Algiers in
  1953 while her husband was in exile in France. Hadj was refused permissio
 n to visit her on her death bed. A cortege of 10\,000 followed her coffin\
 , draped in the Algerian flag\, through the streets of the Algerian capita
 l on its way to the port.\n\nÉmilie's funeral in Neuves-Maisons was atten
 ded by delegations from many socialist parties. Under police surveillance\
 , Hadj gave a eulogy recalling her activism\, declaring her "the symbol of
  the union of the Algerian and French peoples in their shared struggle".\n
 \nIn 1962\, nine years after Émilie's death\, Algeria achieved independen
 ce from France. In 2015\, journalist Rabah Zanoun produced a film about Bu

  whose goal was the establishment of an independent Irish Republic\, rose 
 up against the British government\, battling police and burning down polic

 the Irish Republican Brotherhood\, founded in Dublin by James Stephens in 
 1858\, and the Fenian Brotherhood\, founded in the United States by John O
 'Mahony and Michael Doheny the same year. Their aim was the establishment 
 of an independent Irish Republic by force of arms.\n\nIn 1865\, the Fenian
 s began preparing for a rebellion\, collecting about 6\,000 firearms and a
 s many as 50\,000 men willing to fight for Irish independence. The uprisin
 g began on February 14th\, when Fenians attacked a coastguard station\, ro
 bbed a man's house and stole his horses\, and killed one policeman in Coun
 ty Kerry\, however they retreated after discovering Killarney was occupied
  by the British Army.\n\nThe main rebellion took place on March 5th\, when
  an uprising broke out in Dublin\, Cork City\, and Limerick. Twelve people
  were killed\, and the attempted revolution failed\, in part to poor plann
 ing by the Irish and competent surveillance and suppression by the British
  government.\n\nThe Irish Republicans declared a briefly lived provisional
  government during the rebellion. Here is an excerpt from their declaratio
 n:\n\n"We have suffered centuries of outrage\, enforced poverty\, and bitt
 er misery. Our rights and liberties have been trampled on by an alien aris
 tocracy\, who treating us as foes\, usurped our lands\, and drew away from
  our unfortunate country all material riches.\n\nThe real owners of the so

 eek the means of living\, and the political rights denied to them at home\
 , while our men of thought and action were condemned to loss of life and l
 iberty. But we never lost the memory and hope of a national existence."

DESCRIPTION:Rosa Luxemburg\, born on this day in 1871\, was a revolutionar
 y Polish Marxist philosopher and economist who was assassinated by the rig
 ht-wing Freikorps paramilitary alongside her collaborator\, Karl Liebknech
 t.\n\nLuxemburg was born to a Jewish family living in the Russian sector o
 f Poland after the country was partitioned a century earlier. While enroll
 ed in an all-girls' gymnasium in Warsaw\, Rosa studied banned Polish texts
  and was a member of the illegal\, leftist Proletariat Party.\n\nLuxemburg
  was very politically active\, and an influential member of many political
  parties. In succession\, she served as a member of the Social Democracy o
 f the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL)\, the Social Democratic Par
 ty of Germany (SPD)\, the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) and\,
  finally\, the Communist Party of Germany (KPD)\, which she co-founded wit
 h Liebknecht.\n\nAmong Luxemburg's noted works are "Social Reform or Revol
 ution?" (1900)\, "The Mass Strike\, the Political Party and the Trade Unio
 ns" (1906)\, and "The Accumulation of Capital" (1913).\n\nIn 1918-19\, Lux
 emberg publicly supported a violent rebellion against the German state\, o
 rganizing through the KPD and the Spartacist League. She was captured and 
 summarily executed by the Freikorps\, government-sponsored paramilitary gr
 oups consisting mostly of World War I veterans. Her body was thrown in the
  Landwehr Canal in Berlin.\n\nDue to her pointed criticism of both Leninis
 t and more moderate social democratic schools of socialism\, Luxemburg's l
 egacy is a revolutionary school of socialist thought that exists outside o
 f either tradition.\n\n"Without general elections\, without freedom of the
  press\, freedom of speech\, freedom of assembly\, without the free battle
  of opinions\, life in every public institution withers away\, becomes a c
 aricature of itself\, and bureaucracy rises as the only deciding factor."\

  met his future wife\, Deng Yingchao while participating in a radical poli

 ce\, where he helped form the overseas branch of the Chinese Communist Par
 ty. He also lived in Britain and Germany before returning to China in 1924
 .\n\nWhile working in the Political Department of the Whampoa Military Aca
 demy\, Zhou was also made the secretary of the Communist Party of Guangdon
 g-Guangxi\, and served as the CCP representative with the rank of major-ge
 neral.\n\nAfter the Chinese Civil War broke out in 1927\, Zhou served in t
 he communist forces\, helping establish and oversee a network of undergrou
 nd cells of communist resistance. Zhou played a leading role in the Long M
 arch of 1934-35\, an arduous military retreat of communist forces over 8\,
 000 miles.\n\nFollowing the Zunyi Conference in 1935\, Mao Zedong became Z
 hou's assistant. After the conclusion of the Long March\, Mao officially t
 ook over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the CCP\, while Zhou took a seco
 ndary position as vice-chairman. Both would hold their leadership position
 s until their deaths in 1976.\n\nZhou was a prominent participant in the 1
 955 Asian–African Conference\, held in Indonesia. The conference produce
 d a declaration in strongly in favor of peace\, the abolition of nuclear a
 rms\, general arms reduction\, and the principle of universal representati

  bomb was exploded on Asian soil."\n\nZhou passed away from bladder cancer
  on January 8th\, 1976\, just nine months before Mao Zedong's death in Sep
 tember that year. Frederick C. Teiwes and Warren Sun\, two Australian hist

 ning would be directed against him and his policies\, as Zhou's later year
 s had been closely associated with reversing and moderating its excesses. 
 Out of this concern\, Mao thus suppressed public expressions of mourning i
 n the period following his death.\n\n"Today the first unification of the C
 hinese people has emerged. The people themselves have become the masters o
 f Chinese soil\, and the rule of the reactionaries in China has been irrev
 ocably overthrown."\n\n- Zhou Enlai\, from "Chinese People Will not Tolera

  leading to more than 26 million lost workdays in what the BBC termed "the
  most bitter industrial dispute in British history".\n\nThe strike action 
 was led by Arthur Scargill of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)\, wh

 hortages as leverage (a tactic used in 1972). Opposition to the strike was
  led by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\, 
 who wanted to reduce the power of the trade unions.\n\nThe strike was rule
 d illegal in September 1984\, as no national ballot of NUM members had bee
 n held\, and the labor action failed on March 3rd\, 1985. It was a definin
 g moment in British industrial relations\, with NUM's defeat significantly
  weakening the trade union movement and providing a major victory for That
 cher and the Conservative Party.\n\nThe number of strikes fell sharply in 
 1985\, and all of Britain's working pits were closed in the following thre
 e decades. Poverty significantly increased in former coal mining areas\; i
 n 1994\, Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire was the poorest settlement in the

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1965\, U.S. civil rights activists attempting t
 o march from Selma\, Alabama to the state capital in protest of voting dis
 crimination were attacked by police and deputized white citizens\, an even
 t known as "Bloody Sunday". The several hundred protesters were making the
 ir first of three attempts to complete the march\, which was 54 miles long
 .\n\nThe march had gone according to plan until protesters reached the Edm
 und Pettus Bridge\, where they encountered a wall of state troopers and co
 unty posse waiting for them on the other side. Earlier that day\, County S
 heriff Jim Clark had ordered all white men in Dallas County over the age o
 f 21 to report to the courthouse that morning to be deputized.\n\nThe poli
 ce began assaulting the demonstrators\, knocking many to the ground and be
 ating them with nightsticks. Another detachment of troopers fired tear gas
 \, and mounted officers charged the crowd on horseback. One marcher\, a 14
  year old girl\, required 28 stiches in the back of her head.\n\nThis assa
 ult ended the first attempt of protesters to march to Montgomery\, but it 
 brought international attention to the protest. On March 21st\, a third at
 tempt was made to march to Montgomery\, this one successful and culminatin
 g in 25\,000 people arriving at the state capitol building.\n\nThe protest
  was a watershed moment in the civil rights struggle. By the next year\, 1
 1\,000 black people successfully registered to vote in Selma\, up from jus
 t 130.

DESCRIPTION:Lucy Parsons was an American labor organizer and anarcho-commu

 d by the Chicago Police Department as "more dangerous than a thousand riot

 anarchist Albert Parsons\, contributing to "The Alarm"\, a radical newspap

 r that supported the IWW\, and worked with the International Labor Defense
 \, a communist legal advocacy group that defended the Scottsboro Boys and 
 Angelo Herndon.\n\nFollowing her husband's 1887 infamous execution in rela
 tion to the Haymarket affair\, Parsons remained committed to radical labor
  organizing. One of her last appearances was a speech to striking workers 
 at International Harvester in February 1941\, at approximately 90 years ol
 d.\n\nParsons was prescient on the nature of labor conflict\, stating "My 
 conception of the strike of the future is not to strike and go out and sta
 rve\, but to strike and remain in\, and take possession of the necessary p
 roperty of production"\, anticipating the labor tactics of sit-down strike
 s and worker occupations.\n\n"Never be deceived that the rich will allow y
 ou to vote away their wealth."\n\n- Lucy Parsons

COMMENT:Rudi Dutschke\, born on this day in 1940\, was a socialist German 
 sociologist and anti-war activist. In 1967\, he advocated for radicals to 
 take a "long march through the institutions" as a non-violent way to seek 
 revolutionary change.
DESCRIPTION:Rudi Dutschke\, born on this day in 1940\, was a socialist Ger
 man sociologist and anti-war activist. In 1967\, he advocated for radicals
  to take a "long march through the institutions" as a non-violent way to s
 eek revolutionary change.\n\nRudi Dutschke grew up in post-war East German
 y. As a youth\, he became involved with the Evangelical Church in East Ger
 many and would later claim religious inspiration for his socialism\, tying
  the idea of spiritual transcendence with societal transcendence.\n\nDutsc
 hke's views on socialism\, influenced by worker councils during the Hungar
 ian Uprising of 1956\, put him in conflict with GDR authorities\, and he d
 efected to West Germany shortly before construction of the Berlin Wall beg
 an in 1961.\n\nDutschke became influenced by ideas of social provocation p
 roposed by the Situationist International\, and joined the Situationist gr
 oup Subversive Action in 1963. He edited their newspaper and wrote about r
 evolutionary developments in the Third World.\n\nSubversive Action would l
 ater join the German Socialist Students' Union\, which had formerly been t
 he student wing of the social democratic SPD before being expelled due to 
 being well to the left of its parent organization. After being elected to 
 the political council of the West Berlin SDS in 1965\, Dutschke became a m
 ajor leader calling for student resistance in West Germany\, focusing on t
 he Vietnam War in particular.\n\nAs the movement grew\, Dutschke's visibil
 ity made him a figure of attack from right-wing politicians and press\, su
 ch as those owned by Axel Springer\, which controlled around 67% of West G
 ermany's press market at the time. His family was forced to leave their ap
 artment after it was attacked with smoke bombs\, excrement\, and threateni
 ng graffiti.\n\nIn 1967\, Dutschke famously advocated for a "long march th
 rough the institutions"\, to join political and media establishments to bu
 ild power for leftist movements from within.\n\nOn April 11th\, 1968\, whi
 le attempting to collect a prescription for his infant son\, Dutschke was 
 shot by Josef Bachmann\, a young laborer with ties to neo-Nazi groups. Bac
 hmann shouted "you dirty\, communist pig!" and shot him three times.\n\nBa
 chman claimed to have been inspired by the assassination of MLK Jr.\, whic
 h had taken place just a week prior. The assassination attempt spawned ano
 ther wave of attacks on Springer Press facilities by protestors\, and the 
 shooting was viewed as a major factor in the rise of the militant Red Army
  Faction (RAF).\n\nWhile Dutschke survived\, he suffered from significant 
 memory and speech issues along with epileptic seizures\, and was soon forc
 ed to step down from his political roles. He moved with his family to Engl
 and in 1969\, only to be accused by the Conservative Party-controlled UK H
 ome Office of engaging in political activity in 1971 and expelled\, before
  taking up a teaching role at the University of Aarhus in Denmark.\n\nDuts
 chke would later maintain limited political involvement during the 1970s\,
  supporting East German dissidents. His thoughts on the Red Army Faction d
 uring this time remain controversial\; when RAF member Holger Meins died o
 n hunger strike\, he commented at his grave\; "the struggle continues". Ho
 wever\, he grew critical of their actions which risked harm to civilians a
 nd people rather than infrastructure and objects.\n\nIn December 1978\, Du
 tschke wrote\, "Every small citizens' initiative\, every political and soc
 ial youth\, women\, unemployed\, pensioner and class struggle movement is 
 a hundred times more valuable and qualitatively different than the most sp
 ectacular action of individual terror".\n\nDutschke died on December 24th\
 , 1979 after suffering an epileptic seizure while taking a bath at his hom
 e in Denmark\, causing him to drown. Thousands gathered at his funeral\, w
 here Protestant theologian Helmut Gollwitzer described him as someone "fou
 ght passionately\, but not fanatically\, for a more humane world".

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1971\, a group of activists known as the "Citiz
 ens' Commission" broke into an FBI field office and stole over 1\,000 clas
 sified documents\, exposing COINTELPRO\, a widespread surveillance operati
 on of left-wing activists.\n\nThe "Citizens' Commission to Investigate the
  FBI" was an activist group that operated in the U.S. during the early 197
 0s\, of which this is their only known action. Members of the raid mailed 
 these documents anonymously to several U.S. newspapers\, most of which ref
 used to publish the information. The Washington Post was the first newspap
 er willing to publish the story.\n\nThe documents detailed widespread ille
 gal surveillance on civil rights activists and contained some of the FBI's
  most self-incriminating documents\, including several that detailed the F
 BI's use of postal workers and switchboard operators to spy on black civil
  rights activists.\n\nNoam Chomsky stated that analysis of the stolen docu
 ments show that 40% of them were devoted to political surveillance\, inclu
 ding two cases involving right-wing groups\, ten concerning immigrants\, a
 nd over two hundred on left or liberal groups. Notably\, Muhammed Ali\, wh
 ose 1971 fight with Joe Frazier provided cover for the burglary\, was hims
 elf a target of this surveillance.\n\nThe perpetrators were never caught. 
 Over 40 years after the break-in\, some participants decided to go public 
 with their story. In 2014\, Betty Medsger's book "The Burglary: The Discov
 ery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret F.B.I." was released\, which details the b
 urglary and revealed the identities of five of the eight participants. In

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1917\, the February Revolution began in Russia 
 when tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets\, demanding an en
 d to food shortages\, World War I\, and autocratic rule by Nicholas II.\n\
 nThe anti-government protests took place in the context of deeply unpopula
 r Russian participation in World War I\, which had garnered six million ca
 sualties and a desertion rate of about 34\,000 soldiers a month in early 1
 917.\n\nBy February\, the majority of people in Petrograd (modern day St. 
 Petersburg) had lost faith in the Tsarist regime. The first major protest 
 of the February Revolution occurred on March 3rd when workers at Petrograd
 's largest industrial plant\, the Putilov Factory\, announced a strike to 
 demonstrate against the government.\n\nOn March 8th\, the strikers were jo
 ined by workers celebrating International Women's Day and protesting food 
 rations. These workers recruited more than 50\,000 people from other plant
 s. By March 10th\, nearly all industry was shut down due to at least 250\,
 000 workers participating in anti-government demonstrations.\n\nOn March 1
 2th\, the majority of the city garrison joined the protesters\, who seized
  Petrograd and began hunting police and shooting city officials. Despite a
  senior government official warning Nicholas II that "any procrastination 
 [in addressing the protests] is tantamount to death"\, Nicholas responded 
 "again\, this fat [official] has written me lots of nonsense\, to which I 
 shall not even deign to reply". He was forced to abdicate the throne three
  days later.\n\nPower was then shared by the Petrograd Soviet and a Provis
 ional Government (formed by the Provisional Committee of the State Duma\, 
 a representational branch of the previous government)\, declared on March 
 16th.\n\nThe relationship proved untenable\, however (Lenin\, for example\
 , insisted on offering no support to the Provisional Government)\, and ult
 imately it was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution late
 r that year.

 pay\, voting rights\, and an end to child labor. The slogan "Bread and Ros

 d roses for better living standards.\n\nInternational Women's Day in 1917 
 was also the date of the Russian February Revolution\, in which workers ce
 lebrating International Women's Day joined protests and riots against food
  rationing\, with more than 50\,000 people in the streets. The protests gr
 ew quickly and developed revolutionary fervor\, eventually overthrowing th

  Women in Copenhagen\, Denmark. Clara Zetkin\, a German socialist\, sugges
 ted a holiday honoring the strike of garment workers in the U.S. The propo

  army\, stormed the Presidential Palace with squads of troops and police s
 urrounding the building. President Prío had left the area 30 minutes befo
 re however\, and the palace was seized without violence.\n\nThe United Sta
 tes recognized his government on March 27th\, and Batista allowed U.S. fin
 ancial interests to dominate Cuba's economy. By the late 1950s\, U.S. capi
 talists owned 90% of Cuban mines\, 80% of its public utilities\, 50% of it
 s railways\, 40% of its sugar production and 25% of its bank deposits\, ap
 proximately $1 billion in total assets.\n\nWhen asked to analyze Batista's
  government\, historian Arthur Schlesinger wrote "The corruption of the Go

 t me who signed the Teheran and Yalta treaties with the English and the Am

  England!"\n\nVassev died the day before his release was scheduled\, poiso

  that the resources of the sea are used for the benefit of all the people 
 of the world and not for a tiny minority of profiteers".\n\nThe new govern
 ment developed an ambitious social program\, initiating a literacy campaig
 n\, expanding education programs\, worker protections\, and establishing f

  from 49% to 14%\, the ratio of doctors per person increased from 1/4000 t
 o 1/3\,000\, the infant mortality rate was reduced\, and the literacy rate
  increased from 85% to 90%. In addition\, laws guaranteeing equal pay for 
 equal work for women were passed\, and mothers were guaranteed three month
 s' maternity leave.\n\nThe government suspended the constitution of the pr

 ave demonstrated beyond doubt that there is no reason why we should contin

  following years of mass working class protests on their behalf.\n\nThe "T
 olpuddle Martyrs" - George and James Loveless\; James Hammett\; James Brin
 e\; Thomas and John Standfield - had previously formed the "Friendly Socie
 ty of Agricultural Labourers" to organize around their shared interest as 
 farm workers. Their arrests took place during a crackdown on protest and w
 orker agitation by the British ruling class following the Swing Riots of 1
 830.\n\nThe six men were charged with "taking an illegal oath" under the M
 utiny Act of 1797\, as they had sworn each other to secrecy in order to av
 oid repression by authorities. The prosecution was driven by their boss\, 
 local landowner James Frampton\, who also sat on the jury during their tri
 al.\n\nAll six men were sentenced to seven years' transportation to Austra
 lia in March 1834\, sparking outcry from the organized labor movement. On 
 April 21st\, 1834\, 30\,000 people gathered in modern day King's Cross to 
 present an 800\,000-strong petition on the men's behalf. Home Secretary Lo
 rd Melbourne avoided the workers by hiding behind a set of curtains.\n\nAf
 ter the government attempted to provide conditional pardons in June 1835\,
  the unions continued to push further\, compelling the state to give full\
 , unconditional pardons to all six men on March 14th\, 1836. The men final
 ly returned home from Australia between 1837 and 1839.\n\nThe case of the 
 Tolpuddle Martyrs became an important milestone and a success for the earl
 y English worker movement. Today\, this working class victory is commemora

DESCRIPTION:Nikolai Bukharin was a prominent Bolshevik revolutionary and M
 arxist theorist who was executed by the Soviet Union on this day in 1938\,
  following a controversial trial and international pleas for clemency.\n\n
 As a young man\, Bukharin joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Part
 y in 1906\, becoming a member of the Bolshevik faction. He served on a com
 mittee that was infiltrated by the Tsarist secret police\, the Okhrana\, a
 nd was imprisoned and exiled in 1911.\n\nIn 1911\, Bukharin escaped exile\
 , fleeing to Germany. During this period\, he met Vladimir Lenin for the f
 irst time and authored "Imperialism and World Economy"\, a work that preda
 ted and influenced Lenin's "Imperialism\, the Highest Stage of Capitalism"
 .\n\nAfter Lenin's death in 1924\, Bukharin became a full member of the Po
 litburo\, allying himself with Stalin in the power struggles of that perio
 d. Bukharin formulated the thesis of "Socialism in One Country" put forth 
 by Stalin in 1924\, which argued that socialism could be developed in a si
 ngle country\, even one as underdeveloped as Russia.\n\nBukharin was align
 ed with the forces that defeated Leon Trotsky\, Lev Kamenev\, and Grigory 
 Zinoviev in various power struggles within the Communist Party. A supporte
 r of the market-based New Economic Policy (NEP)\, Bukharin opposed Stalin'
 s support of collectivization policies in the late 1920s. On this basis\, 
 he was criticized and began politically conspiring against Stalin.\n\nAfte
 r the trial and execution of Zinoviev\, Kamenev\, and other leftist Old Bo
 lsheviks in 1936\, Bukharin was arrested in 1937 and charged with conspiri
 ng to overthrow the Soviet state. The following trial was controversial an
 d drew international criticism\, alienating some communist sympathizers ab
 road.\n\nFrench author Romain Rolland wrote to Stalin directly\, arguing t
 hat "an intellect like that of Bukharin is a treasure for his country"\, d
 rawing comparisons to the execution of chemist Antoine Lavoisier\, guillot
 ined during the French Revolution: "We in France\, the most ardent revolut
 ionaries...still profoundly grieve and regret what we did...I beg you to s
 how clemency." Bukharin was executed by gunshot on March 15th\, 1938\, at 
 the Kommunarka shooting ground.\n\n"We see now that infringement of freedo
 m is necessary with regard to the opponents of the revolution. At a time o
 f revolution we cannot allow freedom for the enemies of the people and of 
 the revolution. That is a surely clear\, irrefutable conclusion."\n\n- Nik

 reer of Farrell Dobbs\, a Trotskyist union leader\, and caused widespread 
 unionization throughout the city.\n\nThe strike grew out of Teamsters labo
 r action against most of the trucking companies operating in Minneapolis\,
  the major distribution center for the Upper Midwest.\n\nThe strike was ef
 fective\, shutting down most commercial transport in the city with the exc
 eption of certain farmers\, who were allowed to bring their produce into t
 own\, but delivering directly to grocers\, rather than to the market area\
 , which the union had shut down.\n\nThe worst single day of violence was F
 riday\, July 20th\, known as "Bloody Friday"\, when police shot at striker
 s who were blocking off the delivery of company merchandise\, killing two 
 and injuring sixty-seven.\n\nEnsuing violence lasted periodically througho
 ut the summer before the strike was formally ended on August 22nd\, with m
 ost of the union demands being met.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1968\, the My Lai Massacre took place when U.S.
  troops in the Sơn Tịnh District\, South Vietnam massacred and raped hu
 ndreds of unarmed civilians\, including women\, children\, and infants. Th
 e event was a war crime and suppressed by the U.S. military despite multip

 een 347 and 504.\n\nAlthough two soldiers wrote letters to their superiors
  about the possibility of a war crime having taken place\, the U.S. govern
 ment claimed that the event was a military victory for several months afte
 r it occurred. It was only after an independent journalist broke the story
  and the true nature of the massacre became public that twenty-six soldier
 s were charged with criminal offenses.\n\nOnly one\, Lieutenant William Ca
 lley Jr.\, was convicted. Found guilty of killing 22 villagers\, he was or
 iginally given a life sentence\, but served only three and a half years un
 der house arrest. The incident sparked global outrage and spurred the dome
 stic anti-war movement.\n\nThree U.S. servicemen who had tried to halt the
  massacre and rescue civilians were shunned and denounced as traitors\, in
 cluding by multiple members of Congress.\n\n"It is why I’m old before my
  time. I remember it all the time. I’m all alone and life is hard. Think

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1982\, the Salvadoran army assassinated a group
  of Dutch journalists and FMLN soldiers in violation of international law.
  The murders caused international outrage\, and the colonel who ordered th
 e attack fled to the U.S.\n\nThe four journalists had arrived in El Salvad
 or on February 24th\, 1982 to report on the ongoing Salvadoran Civil War\,
  fought between the right-wing military junta ruling the country with U.S.
  support\, and the left-wing Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (F
 MLN).\n\nAs part of their work\, the journalists visited Mariona prison in
  San Salvador to interview and film prisoners accused of belonging to the 
 guerrilla forces. The videos filmed by the journalists included shots of p
 risoners' scars\, which the prisoners said were the result of torture.\n\n
 This work earned the ire of the military\, and the journalists were interr
 ogated by the Director-General of the Treasury Police on March 11th. Despi
 te being advised to leave by Jan Pierre Lucien Schmeitz\, another Dutch jo
 urnalist\, as well as their FMLN contacts\, the group decided to stay to c
 omplete their work.\n\nOn March 17th\, 1982\, soldiers from the Atonal Bat
 talion\, acting on orders from Colonel Reyes Mena\, assassinated the journ
 alists while they were traveling with a group of five FMLN soldiers. All b
 ut one of the FMLN guerillas survived.\n\nThe deaths caused international 
 outrage\, including mass protests in the Netherlands. The Dutch government
  conducted an investigation which uncovered the fact that U.S. soldiers we
 re present at the base the day of the massacre.\n\nThe 1993 Report of the 
 UN Truth Commission on El Salvador concluded that the murders were a targe

COMMENT:On this day in 1871\, French soldiers refused orders from their su

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1871\, French soldiers refused orders from thei
 r superiors to disarm working class neighborhoods in Paris\, arresting the
 m and joining working class radicals in the revolution that would become t
 he Paris Commune.\n\nOn the morning of March 18th\, French soldiers member
 s began attempting to remove cannons from working class neighborhoods in P
 aris\, left there following the end of the Franco-Prussian War. As soldier
 s became surrounded by members of the National Guard\, a popular Parisian 
 militia with radical tendencies\, the soldiers' superior officer\, General
  Lecomte\, ordered them to fire on the crowd.\n\nThis order was refused. M
 any soldiers mutinied\, joining the National Guard. Some of the military o
 fficers were disarmed and escorted away\, while others\, including General
  Lecomte\, were arrested. Lecomte himself was executed later that day. Thi
 s incident marked the beginning of a working class revolution in Paris\, o
 ne anticipated by the conservative national government of Adolphe Theirs.\
 n\nOn March 26th\, elections were held to establish a Paris Commune counci
 l\, consisting of 92 members\, one for every 20\,000 residents. Out of 485
 \,000 registered voters\, more than 230\,000 voted. Participation was sign
 ificantly higher in working class neighborhoods than bourgeois ones.\n\nOn
  March 27th\, the Commune was formally declared. Prosper-Olivier Lissagara
 y\, a participant of the Commune and author of "History of the Paris Commu
 ne of 1871"\, describes the celebration:\n\n"The next day 200\,000 'wretch
 es' came to the Hôtel-de-Ville there to install their chosen representati
 ves\, the battalion drums beating\, the banners surmounted by the Phrygian
  cap and with red fringe round the muskets\; their ranks\, swelled by sold
 iers of the line\, artillerymen\, and marines faithful to Paris\, came dow
 n from all the streets to the Place de Greve like the thousand streams of 
 a great river...\n\nA member of the Committee announced the names of those
  elected. The drums beat a salute\, the bands and two hundred thousand voi
 ces chimed in with the Marseillaise. [Gabriel] Ranvier\, in an interval of
  silence\, cried out\, 'In the name of the People the Commune is proclaime
 d.'\n\nA thousandfold echo answered\, 'Vive la Commune!' Caps were flung u
 p on the ends of bayonets\, flags fluttered in the air. From the windows\,
  on the roofs\, thousands of hands waved handkerchiefs...The quick reports
  of the cannon\, the bands\, the drums\, blended in one formidable vibrati
 on. All hearts leaped with joy\, all eyes filled with tears."\n\nThe gover
 nment of the Paris Commune developed a set of policies that tended towards
  a progressive\, secular\, and highly democratic social democracy\, althou
 gh its existence was too brief to implement them with much permanence. Amo
 ng these policies were the separation of church and state\, abolition of c
 hild labor\, abolishment of interest on some forms of debt\, as well as th
 e right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if it was deserted
  by its original owner.\n\nThe national French Army suppressed the Commune
  at the end of May during La semaine sanglante ("The Bloody Week")\, begin
 ning on May 21st\, 1871. Even after the Commune was defeated\, the Army co
 ntinued their campaign of slaughter.\n\nIn an 1886 account of the Paris Co
 mmune\, The Socialist League wrote "Thus was extinguished the despair of P
 aris\; but though the fighting was over\, the killing went on merrily\; fo
 r instance\, in the prison of La Roquette alone nine hundred prisoners wer
 e slain in cold blood\, and without any pretence of form of trial. The cou
 rts martial disposed of others. 'Have you taken arms\, or served the Commu
 ne? Show your hands.' If the judge thought the man looked likely\, 'class
 é' was the word\; if anyone was spared\, “ordinaire” was pronounced\,
  and he was kept for Versailles. None were released — sex or age made no
  difference. Those who were 'classés' were shot at once\; perhaps they we
 re not the unluckiest."\n \nA watershed moment in revolutionary working cl
 ass history\, the Paris Commune was analyzed by many communist thinkers\, 
 including Karl Marx\, who identified it as a "dictatorship of the proletar
 iat." Vladimir Lenin danced in the snow in celebration when the newly form
 ed Bolshevik government lasted longer than the Paris Commune.\n\n"It is ti
 me people understood the true meaning of this Revolution\; and this can be
  summed up in a few words…It was the first attempt of the proletariat to
  govern itself. The workers of Paris expressed this when in their first ma
 nifesto they declared they 'understood it was their imperious duty and the
 ir absolute right to render themselves masters of their own destinies by s
 eizing upon the governmental power.'"\n\n- Eleanor Marx

 \, they also ruled that the school district in question must desegregate. 
 Blackwell's son and approximately 50 other children boycotted the school b

 \n\nAs a result\, Blackwell and some other activists in the community form

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1969\, the "Chicago Eight"\, protesters associa

 le and civil rights activist Abbie Hoffman\, were indicted for conspiracy\
 , crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot\, and various othe
 r crimes associated with the counter-cultural protests in Chicago.\n\nAt t
 he 1968 Democratic National Convention\, activists from around the United 
 States came to Chicago to protest the Vietnam War and other U.S. policies.
 \n\nThe protests were attended by a variety of organizations\, including t
 he National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam\, the Youth I
 nternational Party ("Yippies")\, and the Poor People's Campaign\, led by R
 alph Abernathy. The protests devolved into a melee with a militarized poli
 ce presence\, later described by a federal commission as a "police riot"\,
  outside the Conrad Hilton Hotel\, an incident that was broadcast internat
 ionally.\n\nFollowing federal investigations into the incident\, Chief Jud
 ge William J. Campbell of the U.S. District Court for the Northern Distric
 t of Illinois convened a grand jury to investigate whether the organizers 
 of the demonstrations had violated federal law and whether any police offi
 cers had interfered with the civil rights of the protesters.\n\nOn March 2
 0th\, 1969\, this grand jury indicted eight organizers associated with the
  protests: Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin of the Youth International Party\
 ; pacifist organizer David Dellinger\; Tom Hayden\, Lee Weiner\, and Renni
 e Davis of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam\;
  chemist John Froines\; Bobby Seale\, co-founder of the Black Panther Part
 y.\n\nDespite being charged with conspiracy\, these individuals were only 
 tenuously linked through their participation in the 1968 protests. Author 
 Bruce Ragsdale noted in 2008: "The eight were linked less by common action
  or common political goals than by a shared radical critique of U.S. gover
 nment and society."\n\nThe trial itself was fraught with outbursts from th
 e defendants and celebrity testimony: Seale called the presiding judge a "
 rotten racist pig\, fascist liar" and later appeared before the jury bound
 \, gagged\, and chained to his chair\; Hoffman attempted to bring in a Vie
 tnamese flag to the courtroom and fought for possession of it with a court
  marshal\; witnesses included Phil Ochs\, Arlo Guthrie\, Allen Ginsberg\, 
 and Timothy Leary.\n\nSeale's case was declared a mistrial\, while the rem

  On February 18th\, 1970\, the jury acquitted all seven defendants of cons
 piracy\, and Froines and Weiner of all charges. At his sentencing\, Dellin

 on this day in 1916.\n\nWhen Ota was a teenager\, his entire village\, inc
 luding his wife and two children\, was slaughtered by the Force Publique\,
  a private army created by Belgian King Leopold to enforce rubber producti
 on quotas. Benga was then kidnapped by slave traders and put to work in an
  agricultural village.\n\nIn 1904\, Benga was freed by an American busines
 sman Samuel Verner\, who was under contract from the St. Louis World Fair 
 to bring back African pygmies to be part of a human exhibition. Verner fou
 nd Benga and negotiated his release from the slave traders for a pound of 
 salt and a bolt of cloth. Verner recruited other Africans for the exhibit 
 as well\, and the group\, including Benga\, was brought to St. Louis in Ju
 ne 1904.\n\nTwo years later\, Benga was hired by the Bronx Zoo to help tak
 e care of animals. After noticing that some visitors paid more attention t
 o Benga than the animals\, zoo officials "exhibited" him in the organizati
 on's Monkey House.\n\nA group of black New York clergymen\, led by Rev. Ja
 mes H. Gordon\, demanded that he be freed. By the end of 1906\, 23-year-ol
 d Benga was released to the custody of Rev. Gordon\, who placed him in the
  New York City’s Howard Colored Orphan Asylum.\n\nBenga began working at
  a local tobacco factory in Lynchburg\, Virginia to pay for his journey ba
 ck to Central Africa. After the outbreak of World War I\, however\, passen
 ger ship travel became severely limited and he was unable to make the jour

COMMENT:On this day in 2003\, Iraq was invaded by the U.S. and a "coalitio

  and displaced 9.2 million Iraqis.
DESCRIPTION:On this day in 2003\, Iraq was invaded by the U.S. and a "coal
 ition of the willing"\, including the U.K.\, Australia\, and others. The i
 nvasion and subsequent military occupation killed more than one million pe
 ople and displaced 9.2 million Iraqis.\n\nThe invasion came after the U.S.
  government lied about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein possessing "weapons 
 of mass destruction"\, including a now-infamous appearance at the United N
 ations by then Secretary of State Colin Powell\, in which he falsely state
 d "Indeed\, the facts and Iraq's behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his
  regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destr
 uction".\n\nOn March 20th\, a coalition of forces led by the United States
  invaded Iraq. The day afterward\, 76% of Americans approved of military a
 ction against Iraq\, according to a March 2003 Gallup poll.\n\nThe invasio
 n and subsequent military occupation caused widespread death\, disease\, a
 nd displacement for the people of Iraq. According to Brown University's Co
 sts of War project\, since 2003\, more than 9.2 million Iraqis have been d
 isplaced\, and more than 300\,000 people have been killed as a direct resu
 lt of violence. In 2007\, Opinion Research Business (ORB) estimated that m
 ore than one million people have died as a result of the war.\n\nKurdish f
 eminist Houzan Mahmoud opposed the invasion\, speaking at a London anti-wa
 r rally in 2003. In a 2017 interview\, she stated:\n\n"I asserted my oppos
 ition to the war on Iraq\, despite the fact of being Kurdish and someone w
 ho has suffered immensely under Saddam's regime. I still didn't think that
  any foreign intervention was going to improve our lives. I also emphasise
 d that this war will only bring more terrorism because it will strengthen 
 political Islam\, i.e. Islamism...\n\nThere is no doubt that we all wanted
  an end to Saddam's totalitarian regime\, but I was opposed to foreign inv
 asion. In this region we don't have a good experience with foreign interve
 ntions and colonialism throughout history. Imperialist powers invade\, des
 troy and support or install puppet regimes to serve their interest only. L
 ook at Iraq and Afghanistan — since the invasion we are faced with much 
 more terrorism\, instability\, poverty\, displacement and mass migration o
 f people. There is a humanitarian disaster and an endless tragedy of war a
 nd bloodshed."

DESCRIPTION:Anton Lembede\, born on this day in 1914\, was a South African
  lawyer\, activist\, and founding president of the African National Congre
 ss Youth League (ANCYL) who played a key role in the ideological developme
 nt of African nationalism.\n\nLembede was born to a peasant family in KwaZ
 ulu-Natal\, South Africa. He showed great academic potential as student\, 
 studying at the prestigious Adams College despite his family's poverty. Le
 mbede later earned a law degree from the University of South Africa in 194
 2.\n\nLembede was the principal thinker behind launching the African Natio
 nal Congress Youth League. In 1943\, he led Nelson Mandela\, Oliver Tambo\
 , Walter Sisulu\, and other to-be prominent figures in the anti-apartheid 
 struggle in forming the organization\, becoming the first elected general 
 president of the ANC Youth League in 1944. The league wanted to reform the
  ANC\, which they described as "a body of gentlemen with clean hands".\n\n
 In 1945 Lembede\, Water Sisulu\, and Oliver Tambo almost succeeded in pers
 uading the Transvaal Congress to expel the communists from its membership 
 for opposing African nationalism.\n\nIn 1947\, at the age of 33\, Lembede 
 died suddenly from an unknown intenstinal illness. Despite his short lifes
 pan\, Lembede influenced prominent South African thinkers such as Nelson M
 andela\, who wrote "From the moment I heard Lembede speak\, I knew I was s
 eeing a magnetic personality who thought in original and often startling w
 ays."\n\nMandela also credited Lembede's ideas as influencing his own - "L
 embede's views struck a chord in me...I came to see the antidote as milita
 nt African nationalism."\n\nLembede is regarded as the architect of the "P
 rogramme of Action" that was adopted as a guiding document by the 1949 mee
 ting of the African National Congress.\n\n"We have to go out as apostles t
 o preach the New Gospel of Africanism and to hasten and bring about the bi
 rth of a new nation. Such minor insignificant differences of languages\, c
 ustoms etc. will not hinder or stop the irresistible onward surge of the A

DESCRIPTION:Pat Finucane\, born on this day in 1949\, was an Irish crimina
 l defense lawyer who defended prominent IRA activists such as Bobby Sands.
  Finucane was assassinated in 1989 by loyalist forces acting in collusion 
 with the British state. No member of state security forces has been prosec

 a prominent Republican family in Belfast. Three of his brothers were Irish
  Republican Army (IRA) members\, two of whom would be imprisoned by the Br
 itish government.\n\nFinucane himself was a criminal defense lawyer. Altho
 ugh he had represented both Republicans and loyalists\, Finucane's most no
 table client was likely Bobby Sands\, a member of the Provisional Irish Re
 publican Army (IRA) who died on hunger strike while imprisoned at HM Priso
 n Maze in Northern Ireland.\n\nOn February 12th\, 1989\, while eating a Su
 nday meal at home with his wife and three children\, Finucane was shot fou
 rteen times by two gunmen. Twelve shots were to his face. The loyalist par
 amilitary Ulster Defence Association took credit for his murder\, alleging
  without evidence that Finucane was a high-ranking member of the IRA.\n\nF
 ollowing a 2001 peace agreement\, the British government promised to consi
 der opening an inquiry into Finucane's death\, appointing an international
  judge to review his case. The government declined to open an inquiry\, ho
 wever\, after the judge found evidence of state collusion.\n\nIn 2004\, Ke
 n Barrett\, a member of the Ulster Defence Association\, pled guilty to Fi
 nucane's murder. The identity of the second gunman remains unknown.\n\nIn 
 2011\, British Prime Minister David Cameron met with Pat Finucane's family

 apartheid.\n\nThe unarmed crowd was met with armored police armed with Ste

  for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai\, a popular Indian nationalist leader wh

 was arrested when he\, along with Batukeshwar Dutt\, exploded two improvis

 m.\n\nAwaiting trial\, Singh gained public sympathy after he joined fellow
  defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike\, demanding better prison conditio

  was convicted and hanged in March\, 1931. Four days before his execution\
 , Singh refused to sign a letter drafted for him that would appeal for cle
 mency.\n\n"Non-violence is backed by the theory of soul-force in which suf

  what happens when such an attempt fail to achieve the object? It is here 
 that soul-force has to be combined with physical force so as not to remain
  at the mercy of tyrannical and ruthless enemy."\n\n- Bhagat Singh

DESCRIPTION:Walter Rodney\, born in Guyana on this day in 1942\, Pan-Afric
 an\, Marxist intellectual who was assassinated by the Guyanese government 
 in 1980 at 38 years old.\n\nRodney attended the University College of the 
 West Indies in 1960 and was awarded a first class honors degree in History
  in 1963. He later earned a PhD in African History in 1966 at the School o
 f Oriental and African Studies in London\, England\, at the age of 24.\n\n
 Rodney traveled extensively and became well-known as an activist\, scholar
 \, and formidable orator. He taught at the University of Dar es Salaam in 
 Tanzania from 1966-67 and 1969-1974\, and in 1968 at his alma mater Univer
 sity of the West Indies.\n\nOn October 15th\, 1968\, the government of Jam
 aica declared Rodney a "persona non grata" and banned him from the country
 . Following his dismissal by the University of the West Indies\, students 
 and poor people in West Kingston protested\, leading to the "Rodney Riots"
 \, which caused six deaths and millions of dollars in damages.\n\nIn 1972\
 , Rodney published "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa". Historian Melissa T
 urner describes the work this way: "A brutal critique of long-standing and
  persistent exploitation of Africa by Western powers\, How Europe Underdev
 eloped Africa remains a powerful\, popular\, and controversial work in whi
 ch Rodney argued that the early period of African contact with Europe\, in
 cluding the slave trade\, sowed the seeds for continued African economic u
 nderdevelopment and had dramatically negative social and political consequ
 ences as well. He argued that\, while the roots of Africa’s ailments res
 ted with intentional underdevelopment and exploitation under European capi
 talist and colonial systems\, the only way for true liberation to take pla
 ce was for Africans to become cognizant of their own complicity in this ex
 ploitation and to take back the power they gave up to the exploiters."\n\n
 On June 13th\, 1980\, Rodney was killed in Georgetown\, Guyana via a bomb 
 given to him by Gregory Smith\, a sergeant in the Guyana Defence Force\, o
 ne month after returning Zimbabwe. In 2015\, a "Commission of Inquiry" in 
 Guyana that the country's then president\, Linden Forbes Burnham\, was com
 plicit in his murder.\n\n"If there is to be any proving of our humanity it
  must be through revolutionary means."\n\n- Walter Rodney

 began\, initiating a wave of violence that killed 1\,500 people\, damaging
  hospitals\, schools\, cultural monuments\, and private businesses alongsi
 de military targets. The bombings lasted until June 10th of that year.\n\n
 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) bombing campaign was its f
 irst military action taken without the endorsement of the U.N. Security Co
 uncil. James Byron Bissett\, former Canadian ambassador to Yugoslavia\, ca
 lled the campaign a "war crime"\, and Noam Chomsky referred to it as an ac
 t of "terrorism".\n\nSupporters for the campaign claimed the bombing was n
 ecessary to stop a genocide of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and to remove Sl
 obodan Milošević from power\, although claims made by the Clinton admini
 stration along these lines were later found to be highly exaggerated.\n\nA
 pproximately 500 of the people killed were civilians\, and the bombs damag
 ed many civilian structures alongside legitimate military targets. Chomsky
  has argued that the main objective of the NATO intervention was to integr
 ate Yugoslavia into the Western neoliberal social and economic system.\n\n
 In 2000\, Michael Parenti authored "To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugosl
 avia"\, which argues that the bombing was predicated on capitalist rather 
 than humanitarian interests.

  he urged government soldiers to desert their ranks and stop carrying out

 g popular radio sermons in which he reported disappearances\, tortures\, m

  that was heavily censored\, Romero became an important source of news for
  what was going on in the country. According to listener surveys\, 73% of 
 the rural population and 47% of the urban listened regularly.\n\nIn 1980\,
  Romero was assassinated while celebrating Mass in the chapel of the Hospi
 tal of Divine Providence\, the day after he gave a sermon urging soldiers 
 to listen to "God's orders" and desert their ranks rather than continuing 
 to oppress the domestic population. Romero's funeral was interrupted by sm

 the mourning crowd\, killing dozens.\n\nIn 2000\, The Guardian named Oscar
  Perez Linares as the assassin\, using declassified CIA documents as evide

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1931\, the Scottsboro Boys were falsely accused
  of raping white women after fending off a group of white attackers\, lead
 ing to a national scandal involving lynch mobs\, Supreme Court appeals\, a
 nd the Communist Party.\n\nThe Scottsboro Boys were nine African American 
 teenagers\, ages 13 to 19\, falsely accused in Alabama of raping two white
  women on a train. The accusers were a group of young white men who were f
 ought off by the Scottsboro Boys after they attacked and tried to remove t
 hem from the train.\n\nA landmark set of legal cases came out of the Scott
 sboro Boys case\, dealing with systemic racism and the right to a fair tri
 al. The U.S. Supreme Court was compelled to force the state of Alabama to 
 let black people serve on the trial's jury\, leading to multiple sets of t
 rials.\n\nOther incidents included lynch mobs\, formed before the suspects
  could even be indicted\, rushed trials\, and disruptive mobs. The Scottsb
 oro Boys case is commonly cited as an example of a miscarriage of justice 
 in the United States legal system.\n\nInitially\, all but the youngest\, 1
 3 year old Roy Wright\, were convicted of rape and sentenced to death. Wit
 h help from the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and the National Association f
 or the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)\, the case was appealed to th
 e Alabama Supreme Court\, which affirmed seven of the eight convictions. T
 he cases were then appealed twice to the U.S. Supreme Court\, which ordere
 d new trials due to the exclusion of black people from juries (Norris v. A
 labama) and violation of due process (Powell v. Alabama).\n\nIn the subseq
 uent re-trials\, Creed Conyer was selected as the first black person since
  Reconstruction to sit on an Alabama grand jury. Despite the successful le
 gal appeals\, most of the Scottsboro Boys were convicted on charges of rap
 e or sexual assault.\n\nThe legal aid of the Communist Party impressed som
 e poor black sharecroppers in the South\, leading to increased black parti
 cipation in the party there (prominent examples include Ned Cobb and Hosea
  Hudson).\n\nClarence Norris\, the only defendant ultimately sentenced to 
 death\, "jumped parole" in 1946 and went into hiding. He was found in 1976
  and pardoned by Governor George Wallace. Norris later wrote a book about 
 his experiences\, "The Last of the Scottsboro Boys: An Autobiography"\, an
 d died in 1989\, the last surviving defendant.

  of the city\, and one of the deadliest in U.S. history.\n\nThe fire cause
 d the deaths of 146 garment workers - 123 women and girls and 23 men - who
  either burned to death\, choked on smoke\, or jumped to their deaths from
  high windows. Most of the victims were recent Italian and Jewish immigran
 t women and girls aged 14 to 23.\n\nThe death toll was high in part becaus
 e the doors to the stairwells and exits were locked (a then-common practic
 e to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks and to reduce theft).
  The incident led to legislation requiring improved factory safety standar
 ds and helped spur the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers
 ' Union (ILGWU)\, which fought for better working conditions for sweatshop
  workers.\n\nThe owners (who survived the fire by fleeing to the roof when
  it began)\, were acquitted of manslaughter charges\, but found liable for
  wrongful death. Although they had to pay out $75 per victim killed\, thei
 r insurance provider paid them out $400 per casualty. Two years later\, on
 e of the owners was arrested and fined $20 for again locking his doors dur
 ing factory hours.\n\nA week later\, on April 2nd\, 1911\, Rose Schneiderm
 an\, a prominent socialist\, feminist\, and union activist\, spoke to work
 ers\, saying this about the incident: "I would be a traitor to these poor 
 burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you go

 Nova Scotia\, Canada who played a prominent role in the American Indian Mo
 vement (AIM).\n\nIn the 1960s\, she moved to Boston and joined other First
  Nations and indigenous Americans who were focused on education and organi
 zing against police brutality against urban indigenous peoples. Aquash par
 ticipated in several key events\, including the 1973 occupation of Wounded
  Knee at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation\, the 1972 Trail of Broken Trea
 ties\, and the occupation of the Department of Interior headquarters in Wa
 shington\, DC.\n\nOn February 24th\, Aquash's body was found in Wanblee on
  the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota\, murdered by an execut
 ion-style gunshot. In his book "In the Spirit of Crazy Horse"\, Peter Matt
 hiessen writes that the FBI and CIA had previously disseminated rumours th
 at she had been an informant and that Aquash had claimed an FBI agent thre
 atened her life.\n\nOn the matter of Aquash's death\, Leonard Peltier stat
 ed\, "I know that [the FBI's] behavior hasn't changed just as I know that 
 Anna Mae was not an informant."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1943\, members of the anti-fascist Dutch Resist
 ance bombed a civil registry office in Amsterdam in an attempt to prevent 
 Nazis from identifying Jews and others marked for persecution\, arrest\, o
 r forced labor. The bombing was a partial success\, destroying 15% of the 
 records\, around 800\,000 in total.\n\nFollowing the 1940 German invasion 
 and occupation of the Netherlands\, everyone aged 15 and older was require
 d to carry an identification card\, the "persoonsbewijs"\, with them at al
 l times. Resistance members soon started to forge identification cards at 
 a large scale – the largest such operation\, led by sculptor Gerrit van 
 der Veen\, produced some 80\,000 forged documents. Forged documents could 
 be easily detected\, however\, because they could be compared against the 
 records in the civil registries.\n\nDisguised in police uniforms\, the res
 istance group approached the security guards and told them that they had c
 ome to search the building for explosives. Believing their story\, the gua
 rds let them in. Two medical students then sedated the guards by injecting
  them with phenobarbital. While inside the building\, the saboteurs then s
 et the building on fire with a series of timed explosions.\n\nFollowing th
 e bombing\, the Nazis immediately offered a 10\,000 guilder reward to whom
 ever could identify the perpetrators of the assault. Within a week\, most 
 of the conspirators had been betrayed to the Nazis and arrested\, includin
 g resistance leader and openly gay man Willem Arondeus\, who was executed 
 along with twelve others. Arondeus' last words were "Tell the world that g
 ays are no less courageous than anyone else."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1871\, the Paris Commune was formally declared\
 , following city-wide elections. "200\,000 voices chimed in with the Marse
 illaise. Ranvier\, in an interval of silence\, cried out\, 'In the name of
  the People the Commune is proclaimed!'"\n\nOn the morning of March 18th\,
  French soldiers members began attempting to remove cannons from working c
 lass neighborhoods in Paris\, left there following the end of the Franco-P
 russian War. As soldiers became surrounded by members of the National Guar
 d\, a popular Parisian militia with radical tendencies\, the soldiers' sup
 erior officer\, General Lecomte\, ordered them to fire on the crowd.\n\nTh
 is order was refused. Many soldiers mutinied\, joining the National Guard.
  Some of the military officers were disarmed and escorted away\, while oth
 ers\, including General Lecomte\, were arrested. Lecomte himself was execu
 ted later that day. This incident marked the beginning of a working class 
 revolution in Paris\, one anticipated by the conservative national governm
 ent of Adolphe Theirs.\n\nOn March 26th\, elections were held to establish
  a Paris Commune council\, consisting of 92 members\, one for every 20\,00
 0 residents. Out of 485\,000 registered voters\, more than 230\,000 voted.
  Participation was significantly higher in working class neighborhoods tha
 n bourgeois ones.\n\nOn March 27th\, the Commune was formally declared. Pr
 osper-Olivier Lissagaray\, a participant of the Commune and author of "His
 tory of the Paris Commune of 1871"\, describes the celebration:\n\n"The ne
 xt day 200\,000 'wretches' came to the Hôtel-de-Ville there to install th
 eir chosen representatives\, the battalion drums beating\, the banners sur
 mounted by the Phrygian cap and with red fringe round the muskets\; their 
 ranks\, swelled by soldiers of the line\, artillerymen\, and marines faith
 ful to Paris\, came down from all the streets to the Place de Greve like t
 he thousand streams of a great river...\n\nA member of the Committee annou
 nced the names of those elected. The drums beat a salute\, the bands and t
 wo hundred thousand voices chimed in with the Marseillaise. [Gabriel] Ranv
 ier\, in an interval of silence\, cried out\, 'In the name of the People t
 he Commune is proclaimed.'\n\nA thousandfold echo answered\, 'Vive la Comm
 une!' Caps were flung up on the ends of bayonets\, flags fluttered in the 
 air. From the windows\, on the roofs\, thousands of hands waved handkerchi
 efs...The quick reports of the cannon\, the bands\, the drums\, blended in
  one formidable vibration. All hearts leaped with joy\, all eyes filled wi
 th tears."\n\nThe government of the Paris Commune developed a set of polic
 ies that tended towards a progressive\, secular\, and highly democratic so
 cial democracy\, although its existence was too brief to implement them wi
 th much permanence. Among these policies were the separation of church and
  state\, abolition of child labor\, abolishment of interest on some forms 
 of debt\, as well as the right of employees to take over and run an enterp
 rise if it was deserted by its original owner.\n\nThe national French Army
  suppressed the Commune at the end of May during La semaine sanglante ("Th
 e Bloody Week")\, beginning on May 21st\, 1871. Even after the Commune was
  defeated\, the Army continued their campaign of slaughter.\n\nIn an 1886 
 account of the Paris Commune\, The Socialist League wrote "Thus was exting
 uished the despair of Paris\; but though the fighting was over\, the killi
 ng went on merrily\; for instance\, in the prison of La Roquette alone nin
 e hundred prisoners were slain in cold blood\, and without any pretence of
  form of trial. The courts martial disposed of others. 'Have you taken arm
 s\, or served the Commune? Show your hands.' If the judge thought the man 
 looked likely\, 'classé' was the word\; if anyone was spared\, “ordinai
 re” was pronounced\, and he was kept for Versailles. None were released 
 — sex or age made no difference. Those who were 'classés' were shot at 
 once\; perhaps they were not the unluckiest."\n \nA watershed moment in re
 volutionary working class history\, the Paris Commune was analyzed by many
  communist thinkers\, including Karl Marx\, who identified it as a "dictat
 orship of the proletariat." Vladimir Lenin danced in the snow in celebrati
 on when the newly formed Bolshevik government lasted longer than the Paris
  Commune.\n\n"It is time people understood the true meaning of this Revolu
 tion\; and this can be summed up in a few words…It was the first attempt
  of the proletariat to govern itself. The workers of Paris expressed this 
 when in their first manifesto they declared they 'understood it was their 
 imperious duty and their absolute right to render themselves masters of th
 eir own destinies by seizing upon the governmental power.'"\n\n- Eleanor M

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1981\, the largest strike in USSR history began
  when 12-14 million Poles went on a four-hour national strike to protest p
 olice brutality and political repression\, threatening a prolonged general
  strike.\n\nIn the early spring of 1981\, several members of "Solidarity"\
 , a very large trade union movement independent of state control\, were be
 aten by state security services when they refused to leave a session of ne
 gotiations regarding a Solidarity strike.\n\nThe incidents became known as
  the "Bydgoszcz Events"\, and political tensions increased when the Polish
  government downplayed or outright denied being responsible the injuries s
 ustained by the involved Solidarity members.\n\nSolidarity made several de
 mands\, including the immediate punishment of officials responsible for th
 e Bydgoszcz incident\, legal permission for peasants to form their own uni
 on\, annulment of a government directive giving only half pay to strikers\
 , and the closing of all pending cases against people arrested for politic
 al opposition to government policies between 1976 and 1980.\n\nIf no agree
 ment between the government and Solidarity could be reached by March 31st\
 , Solidarity planned to instigate a general strike. As a kind of "warning 
 shot" to the state\, nearly all Polish workers went on a 4-hour strike on 
 March 27th\, 1981.\n\nWorkers set up guard around occupied factories\, and
  people still on their job wore red and white armbands to express solidari
 ty with those who were striking. During the four hours of protest\, televi
 sion screens in Poland showed the words "Solidarity-Strike"\n\nSolidarity 
 and the Polish government came to an agreement after this episode\, and th
 e general strike planned for March 31st was averted. The government conced
 ed to demands about police brutality and admitted to mishandling the Bydgo
 szcz Events. In return\, Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa agreed to postpon
 e the general strike.\n\nIn the following years\, Solidarity secretly rece
 ived millions of dollars from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)\, also
  openly accepting money from the anti-communist AFL-CIO.\n\nSolidarity wou
 ld go on to play a key role in the liberalization of Poland. By the end of
  August 1989\, Poland was governed by a liberal\, Solidarity-led coalition
 \, with one of its leaders\, the anti-communist Tadeusz Mazowiecki\, servi
 ng as the first liberal Prime Minister in Eastern Europe for nearly 40 yea
 rs.

DESCRIPTION:Sergei Kirov\, born on this day in 1886\, was Bolshevik revolu
 tionary and Soviet politician. In 1934\, Kirov was assassinated by an ex-P
 arty member\, the catalyst for a series of purges and state repression led
  by Stalin\, sometimes called the "Great Purge".\n\nSergei Kirov (1886 - 1
 934) began his career as an engineer\, becoming after in politics after mo
 ving to the Siberian city Tomsk\, where he became a Marxist and joined the
  Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1904.\n\nAfter the RSDL
 P split\, Kirov followed the Bolshevik faction. During the Russian Civil W
 ar\, he became commander of the Bolshevik military administration in Astra
 khan\, and fought for the Red Army until 1920.\n\nIn 1921\, Kirov became F
 irst Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan\, the Bolshevik party 
 organization in Azerbaijan. Kirov was a loyal supporter of Joseph Stalin\,
  the successor of Vladimir Lenin\, and in 1926 he was rewarded with comman
 d of the Leningrad party organization.\n\nOn December 1st\, 1934\, Kirov w
 as shot dead in his office by Leonid Nikolaev\, a disaffected and expelled
  ex-Party member. Kirov was buried in the Kremlin Wall necropolis in a sta
 te funeral\, with Stalin and other prominent members of the CPSU personall
 y carrying his coffin.\n\nStalin called for swift punishment of the traito
 rs and those found negligent in Kirov's death\, announcing that Nikolaev h
 ad been put up to the job by "Zinovievites" (supporters of Grigorii Zinovi
 ev\, who had been ousted as Leningrad party boss in 1926).\n\nNikolayev wa
 s swiftly found guilty and executed on December 29th\, 1934. Arrests of Zi
 noviev\, Lev Kamenev and many of their associates followed\, as did summar
 y executions of alleged White conspirators.\n\nThe circumstances of Kirov'
 s death have been the source of great speculation and conspiracy\, particu
 larly by Soviet dissidents. One conspiracy\, alleged by Nikita Khrushchev 
 and anti-Soviet defectors such as Alexander Orlov and Alexander Barmine\, 
 is that Stalin himself secretly ordered the assassination\, fearing Kirov 
 as a political rival and requiring a justification to begin mass purges.\n
 \nDespite these claims\, at least two official investigations\, one in the
  1960s and another in 1989\, failed to establish Stalin's or the NKVD's co
 mplicity in Kirov's assassination.\n\nMany cities\, streets\, and factorie
 s were named or renamed after Kirov in his honor\, including the town of K
 irov (formerly Vyatka).\n\n"Whenever there is a conflict between precept a
 nd example\, the latter wins because deeds speak louder than our words."\n

 Jose Maria Sison met Bernabé Buscayno\, who had commanded an armed group 
 during a communist-led uprising in the 1950s known as the Huk Rebellion. T

  the NPA on March 29th\, 1969\, a few months after establishing the CPP.\n
 \nBuscayno became the NPA's first commander\, bringing his fighters into t
 he newly established militant wing. The NPA adopted the Maoist strategy of
  the protracted people's war\, and\, according to liberal journalist Seth 
 Mydans\, has waged the "world's longest-running communist insurgency".\n\n
 In 2017\, the Office of the President of the Philippines designated both t
 he NPA and the CPP as terrorist groups. The United States and the European
  Union have designated the CPP-NPA as "foreign terrorist organizations" in
  2002 and 2005\, respectively.\n\nJose Maria Sison wrote extensively about
  his experiences with revolutionary struggle\, authoring texts such as "Fo

 stributed leaflets\, organized demonstrations\, and held meetings in sever
 al Arab towns and villages.\n\nThe first confrontations began on the eve o
 f Land Day\, March 29th as demonstrators in Arraba demanded the release of
  a local activist\, closing the streets and setting fire to tires. Israeli
  soldiers fired on demonstrators with live ammunition\, injuring many of t
 hem.\n\nThe following day\, the general strike was initiated in Arab towns
  and villages\, including the West Bank\, Gaza Strip\, and refugee camps i
 n Lebanon. Israeli troops and border guards in military trucks and tanks r
 aided Arab communities to arrest activist politicians and disperse demonst
 rators.\n\nIn total\, six people were killed\, approximately fifty were in
 jured\, and three hundred were arrested. When some of the injured applied 
 for compensation\, the Israeli Ministry of Defense categorized the Land Da
 y confrontations as "combat activity".\n\nThe Interactive Encyclopedia of 
 the Palestine Question describes Land Day's legacy this way: "Land Day was
  a turning point in the orientations and tools adopted for Palestinian str
 uggle inside Israel. After Land Day the Palestinians in Israel gradually s
 tructured their presence as a national group inside Israel in a way that w
 ent beyond their local struggles."\n\nDuring Land Day protests in 2018\, s
 eventeen Palestinians were killed\, including five Hamas members\, and mor
 e than 1\,400 were injured in shootings by the Israeli Army during a march
  calling for the Palestinian right of return at the borders with Gaza.

DESCRIPTION:Alexandra Kollontai\, born on this day in 1872\, was a Marxist
  feminist revolutionary who served as People's Commissar for Social Welfar
 e in the Soviet Union and\, later in life\, as a diplomat for the USSR abr
 oad.\n\nAlexandra was born into a wealthy family of Ukrainian\, Russian\, 
 and Finnish background\, acquiring a fluency in both Russian and Finnish e
 arly on. This experience would later assist her in her career as a Soviet 
 diplomat.\n\nIn 1895\, Kollontai read August Bebel's "Woman and Socialism"
 \, which was a major influence on her thinking. In 1896\, she helped fundr
 aise in support of a mass textile strike in St. Petersburg\, retaining con
 nections with the women textile workers of St. Petersburg for the rest of 
 her career.\n\nIn the years leading up to 1917\, Kollontai was active as a
  Marxist theoretician\, educator\, and anti-war activist (opposing World W
 ar I\, specifically). During this time\, she established contact with Vlad
 imir Lenin and gave a lengthy speaking tour in the U.S.\, sharing a stage 
 with Eugene V. Debs and giving 123 speeches in 4 languages.\n\nFollowing t
 he 1917 February Revolution\, Kollontai returned to Russia. Later that yea
 r\, she voted in favor of the decision to launch an armed uprising against
  the government\, also participating in the revolt. At the Second All-Russ
 ian Congress of Soviets\, she was elected Commissar of Social Welfare in t
 he new Soviet government.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Women's Autobiography des
 cribes her efforts within the Soviet government: "The changes that Kollont
 ai tried to bring about were enormous\, involving the complete destruction
  of the old system and the creation of a new one...Kollontai authorized de
 crees that committed the Soviet State to full funding of maternity care fr
 om conception through the first year of a child's life - an unheard of mea
 sure for the beginning of the 20th century. She attempted to establish ful
 l legal\, political\, and sexual equality for women and to redress the ent
 ire marriage code."\n\nIn 1920\, Kollontai joined the left "Workers' Oppos
 ition"\, an opposition tendency in the Bolshevik Party opposed to what the
 y saw as the increasing bureaucratization of the Soviet state. In March 19
 21\, the Workers' Opposition was banned\, along with all other factions.\n
 \nIn 1922\, Kollontai was one of the signers of the "Letter of the 22" to 
 the Communist International\, protesting the banning of factions in Russia
 . The appeal failed\, and a three-man commission\, Stalin\, Zinoviev and D
 zerzhinsky\, recommended her be expelled from the party\, however she was 
 ultimately allowed to remain.\n\nFollowing this incident\, Kollontai began
  to serve as a Soviet diplomat\, becoming one of the first women to work i
 n international diplomacy. Although she initially intended this venture to
  be temporary\, she soon began to regard her work abroad as a kind of poli
 tical exile\, and would spend the rest of her political career in this rol
 e.\n\n"Class instinct...always shows itself to be more powerful than the n
 oble enthusiasms of 'above-class' politics. So long as the bourgeois women
  and their [proletarian] 'younger sisters' are equal in their inequality\,
  the former can\, with complete sincerity\, make great efforts to defend t
 he general interests of women.\n\nBut once the barrier is down and the bou
 rgeois women have received access to political activity\, the recent defen
 ders of the 'rights of all women' become enthusiastic defenders of the pri
 vileges of their class\, content to leave the younger sisters with no righ
 ts at all. Thus\, when the feminists talk to working women about the need 
 for a common struggle to realise some 'general women's' principle\, women 
 of the working class are naturally distrustful."\n\n- Alexandra Kollontai

DESCRIPTION:César Chávez\, born on this day in 1927\, was a civil rights
  activist who served as a leader with the United Farm Workers (UFW) and es

 s Association (NFWA)\, which later merged with the Agricultural Workers Or
 ganizing Committee (AWOC) to form the United Farm Workers (UFW).\n\nCháve
 z emphasized direct but nonviolent tactics\, including pickets and boycott
 s\, to pressure farm owners into granting strikers' demands. His campaigns
  used Catholic symbolism\, including public processions\, masses\, and fas
 ts.\n\nChávez would go on to play key roles in pivotal labor struggles su
 ch as the Delano Grape Strike and the Salinas Lettuce Strike. Although ini
 tially based in California\, Chávez began expanding the UFW\, working to 
 make it a national organization.\n\nViewing undocumented workers as an obs
 tacle to successful organizing\, in the 1970s\, Chávez pushed a controver
 sial "Illegals Campaign"\, using UFW union members to spy on and oust undo
 cumented workers\, alienating some of his allies in the process. Addressin
 g this criticism\, the UFW website states "Like every legitimate union and
  labor leader\, the United Farm Workers and Cesar Chavez strongly opposed 
 strikebreaking by anyone...When it came to how the union was run and its i
 mmigration stands\, no American union or labor leader embraced undocumente
 d immigrants and immigration reform earlier and more consistency than the 
 UFW and Cesar Chavez."\n\nAlso interested in co-operatives as a form of or
 ganization\, Chávez established a remote commune in the foothills of the 
 Tehachapi Mountains.\n\nIn 2014\, President Barack Obama proclaimed March 
 31st "Cesar Chavez Day" in the U.S.\, urging Americans to "observe this da

  César Chávez's enduring legacy."\n\n"The fight is never about grapes or

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1934\, the Iraqi Communist Party was founded. I
 n the 1940s\, the ICP successfully organized the working class\, but was c
 rippled by state repression. The ICP is still active today\, participating
  in the 2018 national elections.\n\nThe Iraqi Communist Party emerged out 
 of a nascent leftist student movement\; Husayn Al-Rahhal\, sometimes calle
 d "Iraq's first Marxist"\, formed the left-leaning group "Mutadarisi Al- A
 fkar Al-Hurrah" (Students for Independent Ideas). A member of this group\,
  Yusuf Salman Yusuf\, would serve as the ICP's first Secretary under the c
 adre name "Comrade Fahd".\n\nUnder Yusuf Salman Yusuf's guidance\, the par
 ty grew with great success over the next decade despite being illegal. The
  ICP supported strikes and walkouts\, its members served as union leaders\
 , and the Party spoke out against government repression. This repression l
 ed to Al-Wathbah\, a period of urban unrest in Baghdad in 1948 in which hu
 ndreds of protesters were killed.\n\nFollowing this uprising\, Fahd and tw
 o comrades were publicly hanged in 1949 after being accused of organizing 
 agitation from prison. The ICP was further hurt after adopting the Soviet 
 position of supporting a Zionist state in 1948\, causing many members to r
 esign and public support to decline.\n\nIn 1953\, communists actively resi
 sted the Ba'athist coup that deposed Abd al-Karim Qasim\, who had good rel
 ations with the Party. Dozens were killed\, and a campaign of anti-communi
 st repression followed.\n\nAfter a brief period of legalization in the 197
 0s\, the ICP broke ties with the Iraqi government following another anti-c
 ommunist crackdown in 1978 and Saddam Hussein's rise to power the followin
 g year.\n\nIn 2018\, the ICP won more than 1.5 million votes as part of th
 e "Saairun" political coalition\, gaining 13 seats. Al-Khateeb\, a communi
 st teacher and feminist\, said upon her victory "the Communist party have 
 [sic] a long history of honesty - we were not agents for foreign occupatio
 ns. We want social justice\, citizenship\, and are against sectarianism\, 
 and this is also what Iraqis want."\n\nIn 2021\, the ICP boycotted the nat
 ional elections in October\, citing "widespread corruption and the lack of
  prosecution for the most corrupt"\, and stating "an atmosphere conducive 
 to holding free and fair elections has become nothing but an illusion expo
 sed by the tragic daily realities and the bitter suffering of millions".

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1990\, 180k-250k people gathered in Kennington 
 Park\, London to protest an unpopular poll tax imposed by the Conservative
  government of Margaret Thatcher\, leading to widespread police brutality 
 and rioting. By 1991\, the government promised to replace the tax\, and th
 e poll tax was repealed in 1993.\n\nThe proposed poll tax was a "Community
  Charge"\, a head tax that saw every adult pay a fixed rate amount set by 
 their local authority according to Daily Telegraph correspondent Nick Coll
 ins.\n\nThe Charge proved extremely unpopular\; while students and the reg
 istered unemployed had to pay 20%\, some large families occupying relative
 ly small houses saw their charges go up considerably\, and the tax was thu
 s accused of saving the rich money and moving the expenses onto the poor.\
 n\nOn March 31st\, 1990\, between 180\,000 and 250\,000 people gathered in
  Kennington Park. A police report completed a year after the riot estimate
 d the crowd at 200\,000.\n\nThe rally was met with a large police presence
 \, and rioting broke out around 4pm. By midnight\, around 113 people were 
 injured\, mostly members of the public and 339 people had been arrested.\n
 \nRadical left-wing groups in the protest\, anarchists and the UK Socialis
 t Workers' Party (SWP) in particular\, were blamed by various media and po
 litical figures for the violence and property destruction. A member of the
  SWP Central Committee told The Times: "We did not go on the demonstration
  with any intention of fighting with the police\, but we understand why pe
 ople are angry and we will not condemn that anger." A 1991 police report c
 oncluded there was "no evidence that the trouble was orchestrated by left-
 wing anarchist groups".\n\nThe large scale of opposition and resistance wo
 uld facilitate Thatcher's fall from power as Prime Minister and Conservati
 ve leader later that year\, and the poll tax itself would later be abolish
 ed entirely\, replaced with a "Council Tax" in 1993.

 I). Convict labor was heavily racialized\; of 120 men brought in to work i
 n the mines at Coal Creek by TCI\, only five were identified as white.\n\n
 On July 14th\, armed miners surrounded the stockades where leased convicts
  were held and sent them by train out of the city. After repeated attacks 
 on mine property and the stockades where prison workers were kept\, the mi

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1649\, a group of commoners began sowing vegeta
 bles on St George's Hill in Surrey\, England. Their movement became known 
 as the Diggers\, agrarian proto-communist dissidents who opposed enclosure
  during the English Civil War.\n\nThe Diggers arose during a time of socia
 l upheaval - England was in the midst of a civil war between the Parliamen
 t\, led by Oliver Cromwell\, and the Crown. While the Parliamentarians con
 flicted with royalist aristocracy\, it did not represent commoners\; only 
 property owners could vote.\n\nDuring the civil war\, other dissenting gro
 ups came into prominence. Among them were the Levellers\, often seen as pr
 oto-liberal\, which supported extending suffrage to all male heads of hous
 eholds\, regardless of property ownership. The Diggers (who called themsel
 ves the "True Levellers")\, meanwhile\, opposed the seizure of land by pri
 vate individuals\, and sought to preserve and utilize common land for the 
 benefit of the common people.\n\nAccording to British historian J.F.C. Har
 rison\, on April 1st\, 1649 a small group of about thirty to forty people 
 began to dig and plant the common land on St George's Hill in Surrey. Over
  the first few days\, their numbers on the hill quickly swelled as they at
 tracted sympathizers.\n\nSoon\, however\, the protesters found themselves 
 under violent assaults from mobs coordinated by local landowners. The lead
 ers of the Levellers attempted to distance themselves from the "True Level
 lers"\, making a statement in opposition to the expropriation of estates.\
 n\nTwo leaders of the Diggers\, Gerard Winstanley and William Everard\, we
 re ordered to appear before the Council of State in London\, where they ar
 gued that the land had been granted by God to the common people\, and that
  they were simply claiming the commons in the name of the poor. They furth
 er expressed hope that more people would follow their example.\n\nOn the s
 ame day\, the group published a pamphlet outlining their beliefs\, entitle
 d "The True Levellers Standard". The pamphlet described private property a
 s the original sin and war as a means which was used to defend the system 
 of property. New Model Army commander Thomas Fairfax considered the men ha
 rmless\, declining to persecute them further.\n\nWhile St. George's Hill w
 ould face regular evictions\, the Diggers would persistently return as reb
 ellions appeared in other areas during 1649-50. The Diggers would eventual
 ly be defeated and driven from the lands via military force in April 1650.
  Many surviving Diggers\, such as Winstanley\, continued to advocate for l
 and redistribution.\n\nThe continuing process of enclosure was a major par
 t of the transition from feudalism towards capitalism. However\, the legac
 y of the Diggers would not be forgotten\, as ownership of land remained an
  important issue for the poor.\n\nThe Diggers would later come to be recog
 nized as proto-socialist\, proto-communist or proto-anarchist\, and served
  as an inspiration for radicals in the centuries that followed. The "Digge
 rs' Song"\, a folk ballad commemorating them\, is still sung to this day\,
  and was covered by anarcho-punk band Chumbawumba in 1988.\n\nDuring the 1
 960s\, an influential radical theatre collective in San Francisco named th
 emselves after the Diggers. In 1975\, a film entitled "Winstanley" was rel
 eased about the movement.\n\nIn 1999\, 300 people\, organized under the ba
 nner "The Land is Ours"\, reoccupied St Georges Hill on the 350th annivers
 ary of the Diggers' commune.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1990\, the longest prison riot in British histo
 ry began when prisoners at the overcrowded Strangeways Prison in Mancheste
 r disrupted a religious service\, shouting "Fuck your system!" and seizing
  control of the facility.\n\nThe uprising took place in the context of an 
 overfilled prison with abusive guards. On March 31st\, there was a 30-minu
 te sit-down protest took place after a prisoner was strip searched and bea
 ten following a visit from his mother. The same day\, a black prisoner was
  beaten in front of other prisoners and tranquilized. The day of the riot\
 , the prison contained 1\,647 prisoners\, significantly over its capacity 
 of 970.\n\nIn advance\, prisoners decided to stage a further protest in th
 e prison chapel on April 1st. A note was passed the night before\, reading
  "There's going to be a riot in the Church of England".\n\nOn April 1st\, 
 prisoners disrupted the service\, interrupting the service with shouts of 
 "Fuck your system!". Prisoners donned masks\, brandished weapons\, attacke
 d several prison guards\, and seized two sets of prison keys.\n\nFollowing
  this\, prisoners seized control of large sections of the prison and began
  rioting. Up to 1\,100 of the 1\,647 prisoners were involved in the riotin
 g\, and by the end of the first day\, 700 of the prison population had sur
 rendered.\n\nRioting prisoners occupied the rooftop of the Strangeways fac
 ility\, communicating with media and crowds below. Prisoners made demands 
 via telephone\, including improved visiting facilities\, to be allowed to 
 wear their own clothes and receive food parcels\, longer exercise periods\
 , and an end to 23-hour-a-day lock-up.\n\nState forces gradually took cont
 rol over the prison from the lower levels upward\, and it took 25 days for
  the last holdouts on the roof to surrender. In total\, one prisoner was k
 illed\, 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners were injured\, and £55m of p
 roperty was damaged (equivalent to £127\,801\,000 in 2020). One uninjured
  prison officer died of pneumonia during the riot.\n\nThe Strangeways faci
 lity was re-opened in 1994. One prisoner told a visiting journalist:\n\n"T
 he better conditions in here are not down to the prison department. But fo
 r the riot\, we would still be in the same old jail banged up all day and 
 slopping out [manually removing human waste]...The rioters brought this ab
 out. These conditions...should not have cost the lives of a prisoner\, a p
 rison officer\, and two huge court trials. They should have done it years 
 ago but it took a riot to get them to do it."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1964\, Malcolm X delivered a speech at Cory Met
 hodist Church in Cleveland\, Ohio\, discussing the strategies of electoral
 ism and armed defense\, stating "In 1964\, it's the ballot or the bullet".
 \n\nThe speech took place less than a month after Malcolm X announced his 
 split with the Nation of Islam\, and in it he signaled a willingness to co
 operate with civil rights leaders. In the speech\, Malcolm X did not aband
 on electoralism entirely\, but stated "Don't be throwing out any ballots. 
 A ballot is like a bullet. You don't throw your ballots until you see a ta
 rget\, and if that target is not within your reach\, keep your ballot in y
 our pocket".\n\nHere is a brief excerpt from the speech:\n\n"I went to a w
 hite school over here in Mason\, Michigan. The white man made the mistake 
 of letting me read his history books. He made the mistake of teaching me t
 hat Patrick Henry was a patriot\, and George Washington - wasn't nothing n
 on-violent about ol' Pat\, or George Washington. 'Liberty or death' is was
  what brought about the freedom of whites in this country from the English
 .\n\nThis is why I say it's the ballot or the bullet. It's liberty or it's
  death. It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody.\n\n...\n\nA revo
 lution is bloody\, but America is in a unique position. She's the only cou
 ntry in history in the position actually to become involved in a bloodless
  revolution. All she's got to do is give the Black man in this country eve
 rything that's due him. Everything."

DESCRIPTION:Isaac Deutscher\, born on this day in 1907\, was a Marxist aut
 hor and activist who played an important role in the British New Left afte
 r being expelled from the Polish Communist Party (KPP) for "exaggerating t
 he danger of Nazism" in 1932. Deutscher is perhaps best known as a biograp
 her of Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin.\n\nDeutscher was born to a Jewish f
 amily in Chrzanów\, in modern day southern Poland\, then part of the Aust
 ro-Hungarian Empire. He first came to prominence as a poet\, publishing ve
 rse in both Yiddish and Polish\, concerned Jewish and Polish mysticism\, h
 istory and mythology.\n\nAround 1927\, Deutscher joined the outlawed Polis
 h Communist Party and very soon became the chief editor of the clandestine
  and semi-clandestine communist press.\n\nDeutscher co-founded the first a
 nti-Stalin group in the KPP\, protesting the party view that social democr
 ats were "social fascists". In an article "The Danger of Barbarism over Eu
 rope"\, Deutscher urged the formation of a united front against Nazism.\n\
 nDeutscher was expelled from the Party in 1932\, officially for "exaggerat
 ing the danger of Nazism and spreading panic in the communist ranks." The 
 Nazis would invade Poland on September 1st\, 1939.\n\nIsaac had left Polan
 d for London in April earlier that year to serve as a correspondent for a 
 Polish-Jewish paper. After war broke out\, he joined the Polish Army in Sc
 otland\, but most of his time in the Army was spent in the punitive camps 
 as a "dangerous and subversive element" for protesting against institution
 al anti-Semitism.\n\nIn 1949\, Deutscher published his first major work\, 
 "Stalin\, A Political Biography". Following this\, Isaac published his mag
 num opus\, a three-volume biography of Leon Trotsky: "The Prophet Armed" (
 1954)\, "The Prophet Unarmed" (1959) and "The Prophet Outcast" (1963).\n\n
 "Socialism does not aim at the perpetuation of the national state\; its ai

COMMENT:On this day in 1948\, the Korean Jeju Uprising began when 3\,500 c
 ommunists attacked police stations in Jeju\, beginning a war with the US a

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1948\, the Korean Jeju Uprising began when 3\,3
 50 communists attacked police stations in Jeju\, beginning a war with the 
 US government and Korean collaborators that resulted in approximately 15\,
 000 civilians killed\, almost all by state security forces.\n\nThe uprisin
 g took place following the 1945 surrender of Japan in World War II\, endin
 g 35 years of Japanese colonial rule in Korea. In the period following thi
 s surrender\, "People's Committees" formed throughout Korea\, localized au
 tonomous councils tasked with coordinating the transition towards Korean i
 ndependence.\n\nWhen the American military government\, the United States 
 Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK)\, arrived on Jeju in late 1945
 \, the Jeju People's Council was the only existing government on the islan
 d. In 1946\, USAMGIK dissolved the provisional People's Republic of Korea 
 and their associated People's Committees on the mainland\, escalating tens
 ions on Jeju.\n\nIn February 1948\, a general strike broke out in oppositi
 on to upcoming elections. Participants attacked government installations a
 nd fought with police. On March 1st\, police fired on a protest\, killing 
 six civilians\, including a six-year old child.\n\nOn April 3rd\, 1948\, 5
 00 members of the banned communist Workers' Party of South Korea (WPSK)\, 
 along with 3\,000 sympathizers\, attacked eleven police stations\, targeti
 ng police who had previously collaborated with Japanese colonizers. They a
 lso attacked positions held by the Northwest Youth League\, a far-right pa
 ramilitary which had previously committed violence against workers.\n\nThi
 s incident is generally regarded as the official beginning of the "Jeju Up
 rising"\, fought between the WPSK and the right-wing alliance of the Unite
 d States\, South Korean collaborators\, and the Northwest Youth League. Th
 e Jeju Uprising lasted until May of 1949\, however communist resistance co
 ntinued into the Korean War (1950 - 1953).\n\nThe conflict was characteriz
 ed by brutal violence and mass deaths\, in particular from state repressio
 n. 14\,373 civilians were killed\, 86%-90% of whom victims of soldiers and
  police. Right-wing death squads committed war crimes with impunity\, exte
 rminating entire villages\, gangraping women\, and executing children.\n\n
 Lower estimates of the total killed are 30\,000 people\, about 10% of the 
 island's total population. The governor of Jeju at the time privately repo
 rted the death toll to be around 60\,000.\n\nRebels fought back by tactica
 lly retreating to bases in mountainous forests and caves. On April 29th\, 
 the Korean\, non-military\, governor of Jeju province defected to the guer
 rillas\, and many police followed. In response\, U.S. military provincial 
 governor William F. Dean ordered a purge of WPSK sympathizers from the ran
 ks of the Korean police\, and three sergeants were summarily executed.\n\n
 In March 1949\, Republic of Korea (ROK) forces launched a final eradicatio
 n campaign\, killing 2\,345 guerrillas and 1\,668 civilians\, marking an e
 nd to the rebellion. After the Korean War between North and South broke ou
 t the following year\, the South Korean government rounded up and summaril
 y executed suspected leftists on the island.

 is. She described her experiences in a widely read series for the Daily Co
 mpass entitled "The Bronx Slave Market"\, in which she goes into explicit 
 detail about the exploitation of black domestic workers.\n\nLater in life\
 , Cooke was an ardent advocate of Angela Davis. She began working with the
  Angela Davis Defense Committee in 1969 and volunteered as national legal

 of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)\, under Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
DESCRIPTION:The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Revolt began on this day i
 n 1971\, the first armed uprising by the communist JVP against the Governm
 ent of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)\, under Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike
 .\n\nThe JVP was initiated by Rohana Wijeweera (shown)\, a former medical 
 student ex-functionary of the Maoist Ceylon Communist Party. The group was
  explicitly revolutionary\, eschewing electoralism\, and drew recruits fro
 m economically alienated youth. In 1970\, Wijeweera was arrested following
  unruly anti-Vietnam War protests in front of the U.S. embassy\, and JVP l
 aunched the 1971 armed rebellion shortly afterward\, while its founder was
  still imprisoned.\n\nThe revolt began on April 5th\, 1971 and lasted unti
 l June of that year. The insurgents were able to capture and hold several 
 towns and rural areas for several weeks until they were recaptured by the 
 armed forces.\n\nThe official death toll was listed as 1\,200\, however ot
 her accounts estimate the deaths to be around 4\,000 - 5\,000 people. The 
 rebellion led to Ceylon severing ties with North Korea\, which it accused 
 of supporting the JVP.\n\nIn 1987\, the JVP launched another armed rebelli
 on\, this one sustained for three years and involving guerrilla warfare an
 d political assassinations.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rohan Gunaratna's research
 \, in this second rebellion\, the JVP killed approximately 200 people\, in
 cluding politicians\, academics\, and military officers\, between 1987 and
  1990. In contrast\, the total death toll of 35\,000 - 60\,000 is mostly d
 ue to violence perpetrated by state-sponsored death squads.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1919\, socialists declared a new Bavarian Sovie
 t Republic during the German Revolution of 1918-19. Revolutionaries formed
  a Red Army and expropriated factories for the workers and luxury apartmen
 ts for the homeless.\n\nThe movement to create this Republic came after th
 e assassination of left-wing revolutionary Kurt Eisner\, who had led a "Pe
 ople's State of Bavaria"\, founded a few months earlier. Energized by news
  of the Hungarian Soviet Republic\, Bavarian communists and anarchists dec
 lared their own soviet government\, with left-wing playwright Ernst Toller
  as chief of state.\n\nToller was quickly ousted\, however\, by German Bol
 sheviks led by Eugen Leviné. These communists received a blessing from Le
 nin to make Bavaria a Bolshevik-aligned state (some leftists\, such as Kur
 t Eisner\, were deliberately distant from the Bolshevik movement).\n\nThe 
 new communist leadership formed a Red Army from factory workers\, seized c
 ash\, food supplies\, and privately owned guns\, expropriated luxurious ap
 artments and gave them to the homeless\, and arrested members of the arist
 ocracy.\n\nThe Bavarian Soviet Republic was short-lived\, however\, as the
  German Freikorps succeeded in violently crushing the revolution by force 
 on May 6th. 600 people were killed in the fighting\, half of whom were civ
 ilians. More than 1\,200 anarchists and communists were put on trial and s
 everal\, including Eugen Leviné\, were executed.\n\nLeviné himself had o
 pposed the declaration of the Republic initially\, thinking that the actio
 n was premature and that the revolution would be betrayed by social democr
 ats. Florian Keller\, of In Defense of Marxism\, quotes him explaining his
  vote to oppose declaring the Bavarian Soviet Republic:\n\n"We Communists 
 harbour the greatest mistrust against a Soviet Republic whose sponsors are
  the Social Democratic Ministers Schneppenhorst and Dürr\, who at all tim
 es fought the idea of councils with every possible means. We can only expl
 ain this as an attempt by the bankrupt leaders to join the masses through 
 apparently revolutionary action\, or as a deliberate provocation.\n\nWe kn
 ow from examples in northern Germany that the majority socialists [then co
 mmon name for the SPD] often endeavoured to bring about premature action i
 n order to stifle them all the more successfully. The whole of your approa
 ch calls for the greatest vigilance. A Soviet Republic is not being procla
 imed by an armchair decision\, it is the result of serious struggles by th
 e proletariat and its victory.\n\n...We are preparing for [the Soviet Repu
 blic] and we have time. At the present time\, the proclamation of a Soviet
  Republic is extremely unfavourable...After the first rush\, the following
  would happen: the majority socialists would withdraw under the first good
  pretext and consciously betray the proletariat. The USPD [Independent Soc
 ial Democratic Party] would join in\, then give way\, begin to vacillate\,
  negotiate\, and thereby become unconscious traitors. And we Communists wo
 uld pay for your deeds with the blood of our best."

  infants and baptizing them at the Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria).\n\nW

 English: "No one can give others what they don't have for themselves") in

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1948\, far-right Zionist paramilitaries indiscr
 iminately slaughtered 107-254 villagers of Deir Yassin\, orphaning at leas
 t 55 children (2 shown). Israel has kept documentation of the massacre sea
 led\, citing security concerns.\n\nThe massacre took place during the 1947
 -1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine. In the months leading up to the at
 tack\, forces led by the Palestinian Arab nationalist Mohammad Amin al-Hus
 ayni laid siege to Jerusalem\, cutting off the city from military aid.\n\n
 Although war had broken out\, the fighting was relatively contained. Accor
 ding to an Arab League general - "Despite the fact that skirmishes and bat
 tles have begun\, the Jews at this stage are still trying to contain the f
 ighting to as narrow a sphere as possible...the Jews have not so far attac
 ked Arab villages unless the inhabitants of those villages attacked them o
 r provoked them first."\n\nDeir Yassin was a Palestinian Arab village near
  Jerusalem\, with several hundred residents (all Muslim)\, living in 144 h
 ouses. Multiple accounts suggest villagers lived in peace with their Jewis
 h neighbors\, particularly those in Givat Shaul\, some of whom reportedly 
 tried to help the villagers during the massacre.\n\nOn April 9th\, 1948\, 
 more than one hundred members of the underground\, far-right Zionist param
 ilitary groups Irgun and Lehi attacked Deir Yassin. The operation took pla
 ce despite knowledge that villagers had signed a non-aggression pact.\n\nZ
 ionist soldiers expected residents to flee rather than fight back. When th
 ey encountered armed resistance\, soldiers resorted to blowing up houses w
 ith explosives and indiscriminately slaughtering all inside. According to 
 eye-witness accounts\, the attackers systemically murdered the village pop
 ulation\, executing children and reportedly raping women.\n\nZionists para
 ded captured adult men in the streets of West Jerusalem before returning t
 o the village and executing them. Money\, silver\, and gold were taken fro
 m the victims. In total\, estimates of those killed range from 107 to 254\
 , and at least 55 children were orphaned.\n\nThe massacre was internationa
 lly condemned\, including by Jewish intellectuals such as Albert Einstein.
  The attack inspired a revenge attack four days after the Deir Yassin mass
 acre - on April 13th\, Arabs attacked the Hadassah medical convoy in Jerus
 alem\, killing seventy-eight\, most of whom were medical staff.\n\nIn 1969
 \, the Israeli Foreign Ministry published an English pamphlet "Background 
 Notes on Current Themes: Deir Yassin"\, falsely denying that there had bee
 n a massacre at Deir Yassin\, claiming that the village was the home of an
  Iraqi garrison\, and calling the massacre story "part of a package of fai
 ry tales\, for export and home consumption".\n\nThe attack caused many Pal
 estinians in the area to flee\, and escalated tensions in the civil war. I
 n 1951\, an Israeli psychiatric hospital was built on the village itself\,
  using some of the village's abandoned buildings.\n\n"They are angry with 
 me that I said these things. Let them first be angry at themselves...I was
  there\, I saw the massacre with my own eyes. Why didn't [Israeli military
  historian Uri Milstein] ever question me about the things I experienced t
 here?"\n\n- Meir Pa'il\, an intelligence officer who provided an eyewitnes
 s account to the Deir Yassin Massacre

COMMENT:On this day in 1968\, Rudi Dutschke\, a key figure in the extra-pa

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1968\, Rudi Dutschke\, a key figure in the extr
 a-parliamentary left opposition movement in West Germany\, was shot by neo
 -Nazi Josef Bachman. Although Dutschke survived the shooting\, he died fro
 m complications due to his injuries.\n\nBorn in 1940\, Rudi Dutschke grew 
 up in post-war East Germany. As a youth\, he became involved with the Evan
 gelical Church in East Germany and would later claim religious inspiration
  for his socialism\, tying the idea of spiritual transcendence with societ
 al transcendence.\n\nDutschke's views on socialism\, influenced by worker 
 councils during the Hungarian Uprising of 1956\, put him in conflict with 
 GDR authorities\, and he defected to West Germany shortly before construct
 ion of the Berlin Wall began in 1961.\n\nDutschke became influenced by ide
 as of social provocation proposed by the Situationist International\, and 
 joined the Situationist group Subversive Action in 1963. He edited their n
 ewspaper and wrote about revolutionary developments in the Third World.\n\
 nSubversive Action would later join the German Socialist Students' Union\,
  which had formerly been the student wing of the social democratic SPD bef
 ore being expelled due to being well to the left of its parent organizatio
 n. After being elected to the political council of the West Berlin SDS in 
 1965\, Dutschke became a major leader calling for student resistance in We
 st Germany\, focusing on the Vietnam War in particular.\n\nAs the movement
  grew\, Dutschke's visibility made him a figure of attack from right-wing 
 politicians and press\, such as those owned by Axel Springer\, which contr
 olled around 67% of West Germany's press market at the time. His family wa
 s forced to leave their apartment after it was attacked with smoke bombs\,
  excrement\, and threatening graffiti.\n\nIn 1967\, Dutschke famously advo
 cated for a "long march through the institutions"\, to join political and 
 media establishments to build power for leftist movements from within.\n\n
 On April 11th\, 1968\, while attempting to collect a prescription for his 
 infant son\, Dutschke was shot by Josef Bachmann\, a young laborer with ti
 es to neo-Nazi groups. Bachmann shouted "you dirty\, communist pig!" and s
 hot him three times.\n\nBachman claimed to have been inspired by the assas
 sination of MLK Jr.\, which had taken place just a week prior. The assassi
 nation attempt spawned another wave of attacks on Springer Press facilitie
 s by protestors\, and the shooting was viewed as a major factor in the ris
 e of the militant Red Army Faction (RAF).\n\nWhile Dutschke survived\, he 
 suffered from significant memory and speech issues along with epileptic se
 izures\, and was soon forced to step down from his political roles. He mov
 ed with his family to England in 1969\, only to be accused by the Conserva
 tive Party-controlled UK Home Office of engaging in political activity in 
 1971 and expelled\, before taking up a teaching role at the University of 
 Aarhus in Denmark.\n\nDutschke would later maintain limited political invo
 lvement during the 1970s\, supporting East German dissidents. His thoughts
  on the Red Army Faction during this time remain controversial\; when RAF 
 member Holger Meins died on hunger strike\, he commented at his grave\; "t
 he struggle continues". However\, he grew critical of their actions which 
 risked harm to civilians and people rather than infrastructure and objects
 .\n\nIn December 1978\, Dutschke wrote\, "Every small citizens' initiative
 \, every political and social youth\, women\, unemployed\, pensioner and c
 lass struggle movement is a hundred times more valuable and qualitatively 
 different than the most spectacular action of individual terror".\n\nDutsc
 hke died on December 24th\, 1979 after suffering an epileptic seizure whil
 e taking a bath at his home in Denmark\, causing him to drown. Thousands g
 athered at his funeral\, where Protestant theologian Helmut Gollwitzer des
 cribed him as someone "fought passionately\, but not fanatically\, for a m
 ore humane world".

  is the code name given to a secret CIA program of mind control experiment
 s\, sometimes involuntary and involving the unethical use of hallucinogens
 \, on test subjects.\n\nThese experiments were intended to identify and de
 velop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to weaken
  the individual and force confessions through mind control\, and often ran
  without the test subject's consent or knowledge.\n\nUnder MKUltra\, the C
 IA created secret detention camps in international areas under American co
 ntrol so experiments could be done on prisoners without being prosecuted\,
  hired British psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron to conduct experiments on 
 patient\, including dosing them with LSD and putting them in drug induced 
 comas for weeks at a time\, and secretly dosed Dr. Frank Olson with LSD af
 ter he asked to resign from the CIA\, resulting in his suicide.\n\nIn 1973
 \, amid a government-wide panic caused by Watergate\, CIA Director Richard
  Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed. Most CIA documentation of the 
 project was destroyed\, however 20\,000 documents survived because they ha
 d been incorrectly stored in a financial records building.\n\nWe only know
  about MKUltra today because of this misplaced cache and a Freedom of Info

 Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage". Although they won reforms\, they neve

 work for the abolition of slavery.\n\nThe organization was re-formed in 17
 84\, renamed the "Pennsylvania Abolition Society" (PAS). This version of t
 he group began to grow more influential\, broadening its membership to pro
 minent figures as Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush\, who both helped wr
 ite the Society's new constitution.\n\nIn 1787\, the PAS unsuccessfully pe
 titioned the Constitutional Convention to institute a ban on slavery. The 
 following year\, they successfully lobbied the Pennsylvania legislature to
  amend the gradual abolition act of 1780\, winning reforms like the bannin
 g of transporting enslaved children and pregnant women out of Pennsylvania
  and the sending of slave ships from the city.\n\nThe amended act also imp
 osed heavier fines for kidnapping the enslaved\, and made it illegal to se
 parate enslaved families by more than ten miles.\n\nThe group's influence 
 waned in the decades leading up the Civil War amid economic crises and an 
 increasing anti-black sentiment in the region. Despite their efforts at gr
 adual abolition\, chattel slavery was not abolished in the United States u
 ntil 1865.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1961\, the Bay of Pigs invasion took place when
  a force of 1400 Cuban exiles\, funded and led by the U.S.\, landed on the
  southwest coast of Cuba in a failed attempt at overthrowing the revolutio
 nary Cuban government.\n\nCovertly financed and directed by the U.S. gover
 nment\, the operation took place at the height of the Cold War and its fai
 lure led to major shifts in international relations between Cuba\, the Uni
 ted States\, and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe coup attempt came after the Cuba
 n government expropriated property from American capitalists. U.S. Preside
 nt Dwight D. Eisenhower allocated $13.1 million to the Central Intelligenc
 e Agency (CIA) in March 1960 for use against Castro's government. With the
  aid of Cuban counter-revolutionaries\, the CIA proceeded to organize an i
 nvasion.\n\nOn April 14th\, 1961\, a squadron of U.S. B-26 bombers camoufl
 aged with Cuban insignias begin a two-day bombing campaign of Cuban airpor
 ts\, destroying a large portion of the Cuban air force.\n\nOn the night of
  April 17th\, an invasion force of approximately 1400 Cuban exiles and CIA
  officers landed on the beach at Playa Girón in the Bay of Pigs. After a 
 few days\, the insurgents became overwhelmed by the Cuban army. President 
 Kennedy refused to provide air support for the operation.\n\nThe invasion'
 s defeat solidified Castro's role as a national hero and strengthened Cuba
 -Soviet relations. Several Cuban exiles and two Americans were executed up
 on capture. Over 1\,000 prisoners were exchanged for humanitarian aid from
  the U.S. government.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1917\, six months before the October Revolution
 \, Vladimir Lenin's "April Theses" was published in Pravda. In the text\, 
 Lenin called for the abolition of the Provisional Government and power to 
 be given to workers' soviets.\n\nLenin had arrived in Petrograd the night 
 prior\, and had previously delivered the content of the April Theses in tw
 o speeches - once to a meeting of Bolsheviks and once to a meeting of both
  Bolsheviks and Mensheviks - before they were prepared in writing and publ
 ished in Pravda on April 17th\, 1917.\n\nThe text contains ten directives\
 , mostly directed at fellow Bolsheviks. In the April Theses\, Lenin calls 
 for opposition to World War I\, total non-support for the Provisional Gove
 rnment\, a new government comprised of workers' soviets\, the nationalizat
 ion of land and banks\, and establishing a new communist international opp
 osed to "social chauvinists" (such as the German Social Democratic Party).
 \n\nLenin also offers analysis of the revolutionary situation in Russia at
  the time\, stating that "the country is passing from the first stage of t
 he revolution - which\, owing to the insufficient class-consciousness and 
 organisation of the proletariat\, placed power in the hands of the bourgeo
 isie - to its second stage\, which must place power in the hands of the pr
 oletariat and the poorest sections of the peasants."\n\nThe April Theses p
 rovided much of the ideological groundwork that led to the October Revolut
 ion\, which took place six months later when the Bolsheviks initiated a mi
 litary uprising and seized the Winter Palace. The full text to this short 
 work is provided below.

 f armed conflicts between workers and coal companies from the 1890s - 1930
 s in the United States.\n\nThe strike lasted for fourteen months\, and ove
 r 5\,000 workers participated. Notable labor organizer Mother Jones (shown

  of 3\,000 armed miners to the steps of the state capitol in Charleston to
  read a declaration of war to Governor William E. Glasscock.\n\nThe confro

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1943\, the largest Jewish revolt during WWII be
 gan when Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto attacked Nazis attempting to deport the
 m to death camps. Nazis razed the entire ghetto block by block\, killing m
 ore than 7\,000 and deporting 42\,000.\n\nThe Warsaw Ghetto was the larges
 t Jewish ghetto in German-occupied Europe\, housing approximately 400\,000
  Jews in 1940. In 1942\, Nazi police and military carried out mass deporta
 tions\, in total around 265\,000 Jews\, from the Warsaw Ghetto to the Treb
 linka killing center. By early 1943\, the Warsaw Ghetto's population was d
 own to 70\,000 - 80\,000.\n\nIn 1942\, it was abundantly clear to the resi
 dents of the Warsaw Ghetto that deportation was a death sentence. Two arme
 d resistance groups were formed that year - the left-wing Jewish Combat Or
 ganization (Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa\; ŻOB) and the Zionist Jewish Mi
 litary Union (Żydowski Związek Wojskowy\; ŻZW).\n\nOn April 19th\, 1943
 \, the eve of Passover\, Nazis attempted another mass deportation. ŻOB ha
 d received advance notice\, however\, and 700 young Jewish fighters met th
 e Nazi police with resistance.\n\nThe rebels lacked formal military traini
 ng and were poorly equipped\, but had the advantage of waging a guerilla w
 ar\, retreating to the safety of ghetto buildings and tunnels after attack
 ing. Non-armed residents also resisted by refusing to cooperate with polic
 e by refusing to assemble at collection points.\n\nIn response\, the Nazi 
 forces\, armed with artillery and tanks\, began razing the ghetto block by
  block. According to Benjamin Meed\, a Jew hiding in the "Aryan" part of W
 arsaw at the time\, the entire sky was red from the ghetto's destruction.\
 n\nResistance lasted for approximately a month. On May 8th\, 1943\, German
  forces succeeded in seizing ŻOB headquarters\, and many of the group's c
 ommanders are thought to have committed suicide to avoid capture.\n\nAppro
 ximately 7\,000 Jews while fighting or hiding during the uprising. Police 
 deported approximately 42\,000 survivors who were captured during the revo
 lt\, most of whom were shot to death in the Nazi "Operation Harvest Festiv
 al" (Erntefest). Many Jews (one estimate suggests 20\,000) evaded capture 
 and continued to hide in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nResisters knew
  that the uprising was likely doomed\, but chose to fight anyway. Marek Ed
 elman\, the only surviving ŻOB commander\, stated that the inspiration to
  fight back was "not to allow the Germans alone to pick the time and place
  of our deaths".

 t took place during the Colorado Coalfield War\, a period of violent labor
  unrest in Colorado from 1913-1914.\n\nThe massacre was the culmination of
  months of labor strife in Ludlow\, Colorado. The massacre began with a me
 eting between an anti-union militia and the labor leader (and former strik
 ebreaker) Louis Tikas. Although Tikas discouraged violence\, the strikers\
 , who had noticed machine guns placed above the Ludlow colony\, took cover
  in ad hoc fire positions.\n\nAccounts differ as to who shot first\, but a
  battle commenced between the armed factions\, leading to nearly a dozen d
 eaths\, including one twelve-year old boy who was shot in the head. After 
 the violence subdued\, Tikas and other strikers were also found shot in th
 e back.\n\nThe chief owner of the mine\, John D. Rockefeller\, Jr.\, was w
 idely condemned for having orchestrated the massacre. In retaliation\, arm
 ed miners attacked dozens of anti-union establishments over the next ten d
 ays\, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colo
 rado National Guard in a 40-mile front from Trinidad to Walsenburg.\n\nAn 
 estimated 69 to 199 deaths occurred total during the strike. Historian Tho
 mas G. Andrews has called it the "deadliest strike in the history of the U
 nited States".\n\nAlthough the strikers' demands were not met\, the event 
 electrified national discussions of labor and had a positive impact on lab

 eby employers could blacklist union organizers and members.\n\nPickets spr
 ead along the Anaconda Road on April 19th to enforce the strike\, and some
  trolley cars were attacked\, with strikers turning men bound for work awa
 y from the mines.\n\nOn April 21st\, the Silver Bow County Sheriff deputiz
 ed Anaconda mine guards to suppress workers. As nearly 400 unarmed miners 
 marched up the Anaconda Road\, they were confronted near the Neversweat Mi
 ne by the sheriff\, Anaconda Copper Mining (ACM) Company officials\, and a
 rmed guards. Shots rang out\, and armed Company agents shot 15 or 16 unarm
 ed miners\, all in the back. One\, Tom Manning\, a 25-year-old Irish immig
 rant\, died four days later.\n\nAnti-labor press claimed\, without evidenc
 e\, that workers shot first. Despite a massive inquest\, no one was ever c
 harged with the murder of Tom Manning. The inquest report included the com
 plete Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx\, entered as evidence against IWW m
 embers and others involved in the events of April 21st.\n\nIn the wake of 
 the Anaconda Road shootings\, federal troops were called to Butte\, arrivi
 ng on April 22-25 as Tom Manning died. Troops were billeted at the Florenc
 e Hotel in the 200 block of East Broadway and elsewhere. They did not depa

  the last major labor conflict in the area until the 1934 passage of the N

 Butte Miners Union.\n\n"The overlords of Butte will not permit their right

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1898\, the Spanish-American War began\, greatly
  expanding the scope of American imperialism\, granting the U.S. sovereign
 ty over the Philippines\, Guam\, and Puerto Rico\, as well as de facto con
 trol of the Cuban economy.\n\nThe war began with an American naval blockad
 e of Cuba\, which was fighting a war for independence from Spain\, and onl
 y lasted three months. The U.S. intervened in the Cuban War of Independenc
 e after the internal explosion of the U.S.S. Maine\, despite there being n
 o evidence of Spanish involvement in the explosion.\n\nThe outcome of the 
 war resulted in U.S. acquisition of Puerto Rico\, Cuba\, and the Philippin
 es\, and signaled a new era of American expansionism and colonialism in th
 e 20th century.\n\nFrom 1899-1901\, the U.S. had to brutally suppress the 
 Filipino movement for independence\, killing between 200\,000 and 1\,000\,
 000 civilians in the Philippine-American War. In 1901\, the American gover
 nment also refused to withdraw troops from Cuba unless their Constitutiona
 l Convention signed the Platt Amendment\, which gave the U.S. government a
 nd capitalists de facto hegemony over the newly "independent" Cuba.

COMMENT:Vladimir Lenin\, born on this day in 1870\, was a revolutionary Ma

 om in capitalist society is no different than in the ancient Greek republi
 cs: freedom for slave owners."
DESCRIPTION:Vladimir Lenin\, born on this day in 1870\, was a revolutionar
 y Marxist theorist who played a leading role in the October Revolution.\n\
 nBorn into a prosperous family\, Lenin was radicalized at least in part af
 ter his older brother Alexander was executed in 1887 for conspiring to ass
 assinate Alexander III. He was subsequently expelled from Kazan Imperial U
 niversity for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsari
 st government and later arrested for sedition\, exiled to Siberia in 1897.
 \n\nOver the next two decades\, Lenin remained committed to revolutionary 
 activity\, authoring influential texts such as "What is to Be Done?" (1901
 -2)\,  "One Step Forward\, Two Steps Back" (1904)\, "Imperialism\, the Hig
 hest Stage of Capitalism" (1916)\, and "The State and Revolution" (1917). 
 During this time period\, Lenin and his wife\, fellow revolutionary Nadezh
 da Krupskaya\, moved frequently\, living both in Russia and abroad.\n\nAft
 er the February Revolution of 1917 ousted the Tsar and established a Provi
 sional Government\, Lenin returned to Russia from Switzerland and played a
  leading role in the October Revolution\, in which the Bolsheviks overthre
 w the new State Duma government.\n\nA civil war of significant political c
 omplexity subsequently broke out\, in which the Bolsheviks defeated conser
 vative\, social democratic\, and anarchist forces to consolidate its own p
 ower. Lenin served as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of th
 e Russian SFSR from 1917 to 1924. In 1918\, he survived two separate assas
 sination attempts.\n\nLenin's ideas are foundational to the political trad
 ition of Marxism-Leninism\, a political tradition which emphasizes the cre
 ation of a dictatorship of the proletariat by means of a revolutionary van
 guard party and democratic centralism\, in which political decisions reach
 ed through free discussion are binding upon all members of the political p
 arty.\n\n"Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as i
 t was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners."\n\n- Vladimir
  Lenin

 , the principal was lured off campus\, the students convinced the teachers
  to leave\, and\, in the school auditorium\, the students agreed to stage 
 a walk-out. This act led to a lawsuit which was one of five cases consider
 ed in Brown v. Board of Education (1954)\, which resulted in segregation b
 eing declared unconstitutional.\n\nAfter the ruling\, rather than desegreg
 ate\, the Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors refused to appropriate
  money from the county school board to the public schools. This refusal\, 
 which continued for five years\, was part of the "Massive Resistance Movem
 ent"\, a Virginia state government policy to block the desegregation of pu
 blic schools. The school - Robert Russa Moton High School - is now a civil
  rights museum.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1916\, revolutionary Irish Republicans initiate
 d the Easter Rising\, proclaiming an Irish Republic independent of British
  rule and battling with the British Army for six days. Sixteen Rising lead
 ers were executed.\n\nThe rebellion was a collaboration of multiple milita

 n Army (ICA)\, and Cumann na mBan\, and an Irish women's paramilitary forc
 e. Notable leaders include schoolmaster and Irish language activist Patric
 k Pearse and socialist James Connolly\, who served as head of the ICA.\n\n
 Together\, this coalition seized strategically important buildings in Dubl
 in. Britain responded militarily\, sending thousands of troops and artille
 ry to clash with the Irish revolutionaries.\n\nThe resistance lasted six d
 ays before surrendering to the better equipped British Army\, and artiller
 y shelling and street fighting left many parts of Dublin in ruin. 3\,500 p
 eople were captured\, 1\,800 of them sent to internment camps. 485 people 
 were killed\, and more than 2\,600 were wounded. Pearse and Connolly\, alo
 ng with 14 others\, were executed for their role in the rebellion.\n\nThe 
 Rising was the first armed conflict of a revolutionary period of unrest th
 at began in the early 20th century. In the "Proclamation of the Irish Repu
 blic"\, the revolutionaries linked their cause to centuries of struggle:\n
 \n"We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Irela
 nd and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies\, to be sovereign and 
 indefeasible. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and go
 vernment has not extinguished the right\, nor can it ever be extinguished 
 except by the destruction of the Irish people.\n\nIn every generation the 
 Irish people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty
 \; six times during the past three hundred years they have asserted it in 
 arms. Standing on that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in
  the face of the world\, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovere
 ign Independent State\, and we pledge our lives and the lives of our comra
 des in arms to the cause of its freedom\, of its welfare\, and of its exal

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1845\, the Mexican-American War began after the
  U.S. seized Texas from the Mexican government\, fulfilling President Polk
 's imperialist campaign promise of annexing both Texas and California.\n\n
 Tensions between either government had already been increasing\, but the a
 ct that initiated the war was Polk ordering troops to occupy contested lan
 d between the Nueces River and Rio Grande. On this day in 1846\, a 2\,000-
 man Mexican cavalry detachment attacked a 70-man U.S. patrol under the com
 mand of Captain Seth Thornton in the contested land.\n\nPolk asserted that
  American blood had been shed on American soil (which Abraham Lincoln call
 ed "a bold falsification of history")\, and a formal declaration of war fr
 om the U.S. government soon followed.\n\nThe outcome of the war resulted i
 n the U.S. acquiring control over Texas\, California\, and large parts of 
 New Mexico\, Arizona\, Colorado\, Utah\, and Nevada in the Treaty of Guada
 lupe Hidalgo. An "All-Mexico Movement" in the U.S. opposed the treaty\, de
 manding that the country annex the entire country of Mexico.

  French sailors on the Ukraine-stationed cruiser Waldeck-Rousseau mutinied

 with more than 22\,000 troops in order to prevent a "communist dictatorshi
 p" from forming there. The military action was supported by the Organizati

 th political instability since the assassination of dictator Rafael Trujil
 lo in 1961. Although Trujillo brutally suppressed the population\, his ant
 i-communism made him a natural ally of the U.S. government. After his deat
 h\, liberal reformer Juan Bosch became president\, but he was deposed in a
  coup after less than a year in power.\n\nIn the ensuing power struggle\, 
 the U.S. was committed to preventing "another Cuba" (i.e.\, a communist re
 volution) from taking place. On April 28th\, 1965\, President Lyndon B. Jo
 hnson declared that he had taken action to forestall the establishment of 
 a "communist dictatorship" in the country\, providing reporters with lists
  of suspected communists there as evidence. These lists\, however\, contai
 ned people who were not communists or were in fact deceased.\n\nThe milita
 ry action was supported by the Organization of American States (OAS). Over
  the next few weeks\, they established a conservative\, non-military gover
 nment\, which held fraudulent elections in June 1966. 69% of American peop
 le approved of the decision to send in troops at the time.\n\nAccording to
  Rory Fanning of Jacobin: "Upon taking power\, U.S.-backed leader Joaquín
  Balaguer began funneling nearly all of Dominican Republic's minerals and 
 sugar into the warehouses of U.S. businesses. His three-decade rule was ma
 rked by corruption and fraud. Wages plummeted\, unions were dismantled\, i
 nflation soared\, and unemployment hovered around 30 percent."

 ficially put an end to the "colour bar". On September 17th\, Raghbir Singh
 \, a Sikh\, became Bristol's first non-white bus conductor.\n\nThe Bristol
  Bus Boycott was influential in the passing of the Race Relations Act of 1

DESCRIPTION:Max Nettlau\, born on this day in 1865\, was an anarchist hist
 orian whose biographical subjects included Bakunin\, Malatesta\, and Élis
 ée Reclus. His enormous collection of primary materials is held by the In
 ternational Institute of Social History.\n\nMax Nettlau was born in Neuwal
 degg (Austria) to an affluent family. Nettlau's skepticism of state author
 ity began at a young age\; his memoirs state that\, even as a child\, he '
 somehow considered the supporter of any government system as a seriously d
 efective person'.\n\nFormally\, Nettlau studied linguistics\, authoring hi
 s doctoral thesis on the Welsh language. While a student in London\, he be
 came a member of the Socialist League\, the only organization he was ever 
 to join according to the International Institute of Social History (IISG).
 \n\nAs an anarchist activist\, Nettlau wrote articles for John Most's Frei
 heit and befriended famous anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin\, Elisée Re
 clus\, and Errico Malatesta.\n\nNettlau was an avid collector of materials
  of social movements. Not just manuscripts by anarchist authors (although 
 original texts by Bakunin became a part of his collection)\, but the actua
 l pamphlets\, bulletins\, and papers of social movements themselves.\n\nAm
 ong Nettlau's works as an author are the first major biography of Michael 
 Bakunin\, biographies of anarchists Elisée Reclus and Errico Malatesta\, 
 and a seven volume work on the history of anarchism. A significantly short
 er\, one volume version is available in English as "A Short History of Ana
 rchism".\n\nIn 1935\, Nettlau sold his archive (described by the IISH as "
 enormous") to the newly found International Institute of Social History\, 
 where it remains to this day.\n\nNettlau died 1944 from stomach cancer in 
 Amsterdam\, having fled his native Austria follow the country's "Anschluss
 " to Nazi Germany in 1938.\n\n"Do I want to propose my own system? Not at 
 all! I am an advocate of all systems\, i.e. of all forms of government tha
 t find followers."\n\n- Max Nettlau in "PANARCHY. A Forgotten Idea of 1860
 " (1905)

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1946\, 800 Aboriginal agricultural workers init
 iated the Pilbara Strike. The strike lasted for more than 3 years before i
 mproved working conditions were won\, becoming one the longest strikes in 
 Australian history. Today\, the strike is considered a major event in the 
 Aboriginal land rights movement.\n\nThe Pilbara Strike took place in the c
 ontext of slave-like conditions - workers were denied cash wages\, paid in
  supplies of tobacco\, flour and other necessities\, and those who attempt
 ed to escape were whipped and hunted down by police.\n\nOn May 1st\, 1946\
 , approximately 800 agricultural workers walked off their pastoral station
 s in the Pilbara region of Western Australia\, setting up strike camps. Th
 e date of May 1st was chosen not only because it was International Workers
 ' Day but also because it was the first day of the shearing season.\n\nThe
  strike lasted for more than 3 years\, and spread beyond the Pilbara regio
 n. Strikers faced severe police repression\, with leaders such as Dooley B
 in Bin\, Clancy McKenna\, Jacob Oberdoo\, and Don McLeod being arrested on
  multiple occasions. Aboriginal women played a vital role in the strike\, 
 both as workers and in establishing strikers' camps. Daisy Bindi\, a Nyang
 umarta woman\, personally led a walk-off of 96 workers at Roy Hill Station
 .\n\nThe strikers sustained themselves with their traditional bush skills\
 , hunting kangaroos and goats for meat and skins. They also developed some
  cottage industry which brought cash payment\, such as selling buffel gras
 s seed in Sydney\, the sale of pearl shell\, and in surface mining.\n\nBy 
 August 1949\, the Seamen's Union had agreed to blackban wool from stations
  in the Pilbara onto ships for export. On the third day after the ban had 
 been applied\, McLeod was told by a government representative that the str
 ikers' demands would be met if the ban was lifted. Weeks after the strike 
 ended and the ban lifted\, the government denied making any such agreement
 .\n\nAfter the strike concluded\, many Aboriginal people refused to go bac
 k to working in their old roles in the pastoral industry. Some were able t
 o pool their funds from surface mining and other cottage industry to buy o
 r lease stations\, including some they had formerly worked on\, running th
 em as cooperatives.\n\nJacob Oberdoo was later awarded the British Empire 
 Medal\, but declined to accept it. In 2010\, four streets in the Canberra 
 suburb of Bonner were named after strike leaders: Clancy McKenna Crescent\
 , Dooley Bin Bin Street\, Peter Coppin Street\, and Don McLeod Lane.

 thers entered the assembly chamber\, where the lawmakers were in session\,
  some legislators reportedly took cover under desks. Police then ordered t
 he Panthers to leave the premises\, and they peacefully complied while ins
 isting they were within their legal right to carry.\n\nOutside\, Bobby Sea
 le spoke to a crowd of reporters. Here is an excerpt of what he said:\n\n"
 Black people have begged\, prayed\, petitioned\, demonstrated\, and everyt
 hing else to get the racist power structure of America to right the wrongs
  which have historically been perpetuated against black people. All of the
 se efforts have been answered by more repression\, deceit and hypocrisy. A
 s the aggression of the racist American government escalates in Vietnam\, 
 the police agencies of America escalate the oppression of black people thr
 oughout the ghettoes of America."\n\nShortly after Seale finished speaking
 \, police arrested the group on felony charges of conspiracy to disrupt a 
 legislative session\, although the protesters would later plead down to va
 rious misdemeanors instead.\n\nAmong those arrested was the teenager Bobby
  Hutton\, the first recruit and first treasurer of the Black Panther Party
 . Hutton would be shot and killed by Oakland Police less than a year later
 \, on April 6th\, 1968.

 red workers being black despite whites participating in the labor action.\
 n\nIn response to this and discrimination within the plant - black workers
  were kept in the lowest-paying and most dangerous jobs\, passed over for 
 promotion\, and the United Auto Workers union (UAW) would not help them co

  company.\n\nIn July\, DRUM called for another shutdown of the plant and\,
  this time\, more than 3\,000 black workers participated in the strike\, k
 eeping it closed for over two days. Their success inspired the formation o
 f other Revolutionary Union Movements in other Michigan auto plants and in
 dustries\, such as FRUM (Ford)\, CADRUM (GM's Cadillac plant)\, and GRUM (
 the larger GM caucus)\, healthcare workers (HRUM)\, and UPS workers (UPRUM
 ).\n\nFrom these organizations\, seven activists organized the various -RU
 Ms into one umbrella organization with a socialist bent - the League of Re
 volutionary Black Workers (LRBW). The LRBW sought to transform the UAW fro
 m within\, eventually compelling the UAW to hire black people into leaders

 volved into a riot.\n\nThe state repression of protesters caused two major
  left union federations\, the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) 
 and the Force Ouvrière (CGT-FO)\, to call a one-day general strike on May
  13th. More than one million people demonstrated that day.\n\nBy the middl
 e of May\, demonstrations had extended to factories\, though their demands
  were different from the students'. Across France\, students occupied univ
 ersity structures and up to one-third of the country's workforce was on st
 rike.\n\nThe protests were so widespread and energetic that many political
  leaders feared civil war or revolution. President Charles de Gaulle secre
 tly fled France to Germany at one point\, and the national government at t
 imes ceased to function.\n\nRevolution was averted when de Gaulle dissolve
 d the National Assembly and scheduled an election that the left dissidents
  agreed to participate in. Revolutionary fervor subsided and the governmen
 t banned a number of leftist organizations in the following months.\n\nIn 
 the election\, de Gaulle's party won the greatest victory in French parlia

  by white working class residents to force broader democracy in the U.S. s

 er Thomas Wilson Dorr\, who mobilized the disenfranchised to demand change
 s to the state's electoral rules.\n\nIn 1841\, the movement held a "People
 's Convention"\, where they created their own state constitution\, ratifyi

 self supported giving black men the right to vote\, the constitution only 
 enfranchised white men.\n\nOn this day in 1842\, members of this movement 
 held an inauguration parade for the Dorr and attempted to create the new g
 overnment. A "People's Legislature" (elected earlier) convened\, and Dorr 
 himself led a failed attack on the state arsenal\, quickly fleeing the sta

 ut lost the case in "Luther v. Borden". This case set a long standing prec

  - 12\,614 people in total.\n\nThe 1971 May Day Protests were a series of 
 large-scale civil disobedience actions in Washington D.C. in protest again
 st the Vietnam War. They began on May Day of that year and continued with 
 similar intensity into the morning of May 3rd.\n\nThe protest began when 3
 5\,000 people camped out in West Potomac Park near the Washington Monument
  park to plan for the coming protest. The next day\, the Nixon administrat
 ion canceled the protesters' permit and police\, dressed in riot gear\, ra
 ided the encampment\, firing tear gas and knocking down tents.\n\nOn May 3
 rd\, President Nixon executed "Operation Garden Plot" (a plan developed du
 ring the 1960s to combat major civil disorders)\, deploying 10\,000 federa
 l troops to various locations in the Washington D.C. area.\n\nWhile the tr
 oops secured the major intersections and bridges\, police roamed through t
 he city\, making massive arrest sweeps and using tear gas. By eight in the
  morning\, police had detained over 7\,000 people\, arresting anyone who l
 ooked like a demonstrator\, including construction workers who had come ou
 t to support the government.\n\nOver the course of several days\, the city
  arrested 12\,614 people\, making it the largest mass arrest in U.S. histo
 ry. Members of the Nixon administration would come to view the events as d
 amaging\, because the government's mass arrests of protesters were perceiv

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1926\, a general strike in England involving ap
 proximately 1.7 million workers was initiated by the Trades Union Congress
  (TUC) in response to coal mine owners proposing reductions in pay for min
 ers the previous year.\n\nThe general strike was broad in scope\, includin
 g workers from mines\, shipyards\, mills\, and engineers.\n\nStriking dock
  workers firmly refused to allow any movement of goods on the docks\, caus
 ing a bread shortage. In response\, the government tried to forcibly move 
 flour and grain to bakeries\, but were prevented from doing so by the mill
  workers and dockers.\n\nDuring the strike\, there were clashes between po
 lice and crowds in many areas and at least 4\,000 workers were arrested. T
 here were attacks on busses and trains\, including the derailing of the Fl
 ying Scotsman.\n\nThe strike was called off by the TUC on May 12th with no
  guarantees of fair treatment for the miners\, whose strike was defeated i
 n October later that year. The following year\, the 1927 Trades Disputes a
 nd Trade Unions Act was passed\, forbidding sympathetic strikes and mass p
 icketing. Civil Service unions were also forbidden to affiliate with the T
 UC.

  their labor power in return for wages.\n\nEmploying a critical approach k

  and sentenced to 14 years in prison.\n\nUndeterred\, Sands continued his 
 resistance in prison. He refused to wear a prison uniform\, and was kept i
 n his cell naked without access to bedding for 13 hours a day. While in pr
 ison\, Sands authored poems and songs\, published by Republican magazines.
 \n\nOn March 1st\, 1981\, Sands initiated a hunger strike in collaboration

COMMENT:Théophile Ferré\, born on this day in 1845\, was a revolutionary
  leader of the Paris Commune. Ferré personally authorized the execution o
 f the archbishop of Paris and was later sentenced to death\, the first of 
 25 Communards to be executed.
DESCRIPTION:Théophile Ferré\, born on this day in 1845\, was a revolutio
 nary leader of the Paris Commune. Ferré personally authorized the executi
 on of the archbishop of Paris and was later sentenced to death\, the first
  of 25 Communards to be executed.\n\nLittle is known about Ferré's early 
 life\, before his participation in the Paris Commune. After Paris was seiz
 ed by revolutionaries in March 1871\, Ferré served on the Commune's Commi
 ttee of Public Safety\, a body given extensive powers to hunt down enemies
  of the Commune.\n\nOn April 5th\, the Commune passed a decree that author
 ized the arrest of any person thought to be loyal to the French government
  in Versailles\, to be held as hostages. Prominent figures arrested includ
 ed a Catholic priest Georges Darboy and the archbishop of Paris. The Commu
 ne hoped to exchange their hostages for Louis-Auguste Blanqui\, a revoluti
 onary and honorary President of the Commune\, imprisoned by the state.\n\n
 Following the events of the "Bloody Week"\, in which the French government
  summarily executed many suspected Communards\, Ferré authorized the exec
 ution of several hostages\, including Darboy and the archbishop.\n\nAfter 
 the resistance of the Commune collapsed\, Ferré was captured by the army\
 , tried by a military court\, and sentenced to death. On November 28th\, 1
 871\, he was shot at Satory\, an army camp southwest of Versailles. He was
  the first of twenty-five Communards to be executed for their role in the 
 Paris Commune.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1912\, the first industry-wide strike of restau
 rant and hotel workers in New York City history began when 150 hotel worke
 rs\, organized by the IWW\, walked out to protest their poor working condi

 ately 2\,500 waiters\, 1\,000 cooks\, and 3\,000 other striking hotel work
 ers.\n\nThe strike was organized directly by Joe Ettor and Elizabeth Gurle
 y Flynn of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Before the IWW\, the
  only union in place for hotel workers only had about 2\,000 members and p
 rohibitively high membership dues.\n\nThe workers demanded at least one da
 y off a week\, a higher minimum wage\, and a prohibition of discrimination
  for being in a union. The strike continued through the rest of May but fa
 ced repression from the police. The strike officially ended on June 25th\,
  1912 without legal recognition for the IWW created Hotel Workers' Interna
 tional Union. Despite this failure\, hotel workers would go on strike agai
 n in 1913\, 1918\, 1929\, and 1934.

DESCRIPTION:John Brown\, born on this day in 1800\, was a militant aboliti
 onist who advocated for and practiced armed insurrection to overthrow the 
 system of slavery in the U.S. He became the first American executed for tr
 eason after raiding Harpers Ferry.\n\nBrown first gained national attentio
 n when he led small groups of volunteers during the Bleeding Kansas crisis
  of 1856. He was dissatisfied with the pacifism of the organized abolition
 ist movement\, stating "These men are all talk. What we need is action - a
 ction!"\n\nIn October 1859\, Brown led a raid on the federal armory at Har
 pers Ferry\, Virginia (modern day West Virginia)\, intending to start a li
 beration movement that would spread south through the mountainous regions 
 of Virginia and North Carolina.\n\nAlthough Brown's group successfully sei
 zed the armory at first\, his raid was defeated by a combination of volunt
 eer militia and state forces led by Robert E. Lee\, who later commanded th
 e Confederate States Army. Seven people were killed\, two of whom were Bro
 wn's sons Oliver and Watson\, and at least ten more were injured.\n\nBrown
  had intended to arm enslaved people with weapons from the armory\, but on
 ly a small number of locals were willing to join him\, possibly due to an 
 unfamiliarity with firearms. Within 36 hours\, those of Brown's men who ha
 d not fled were killed or captured by local farmers\, militiamen\, or U.S.
  Marines.\n\nBrown was hastily tried for treason against the Commonwealth 
 of Virginia\, the murder of five men\, and inciting a slave insurrection. 
 He was found guilty on all counts and was hanged\, becoming the first pers
 on executed for treason in the history of the United States.\n\n"I\, John 
 Brown\, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land can never
  be purged away but with blood. I had\, as I now think\, vainly flattered 
 myself that without very much bloodshed\, it might be done."\n\n- John Bro

 iner's Strike against Canadian Collieries. Following the strike\, he was b
 lacklisted and was forced to move away from Cumberland to find work.\n\nIn
  1916\, he joined the Mining and Smelter workers Union and was elected as 
 Secretary for the Trail chapter. Following his involvement with trade unio
 ns\, Goodwin entered politics running as a candidate for the Socialist Par
 ty of Canada in the 1916 British Columbian election\, although he did not 
 win.\n\nAs World War I broke out\, Goodwin became an outspoken advocate ag
 ainst the draft\, initially refusing to sign up. Eventually\, he was compe
 lled to be drafted\, and\, after exhausting multiple appeals against his c
 onscription\, he fled into the hills of Cumberland\, British Columbia.\n\n
 On July 27th (some sources say July 26th)\, Goodwin was shot and killed by
  a member of the Dominion Police\, who had ventured into the hills surroun
 ding Comox Lake to locate men evading the draft and arrest them for their 
 evasion. The officer who killed Goodwin successfully claimed self-defense 
 in court\, although it is unknown how the two actually encountered each ot
 her.\n\nIn protest to his murder\, the first general strike in Canada\, th
 e Vancouver General Strike\, took place on August 2nd\, 1918. In 2015\, a 
 film about his life titled "Goodwin's Way" was released.\n\n"War is simply
  part of the process of Capitalism. Big financial interests are playing th
 e game. They'll reap the victory\, no matter how the war ends."\n\n- Alber

 t revolutionary and radical journalist who was assassinated by a far-right
  nationalist while serving as head of the People's State of Bavaria.\n\nKu
 rt Eisner\, born to a Jewish family in Berlin\, was a revolutionary German
  socialist\, radical journalist\, and theater critic. Before leading the P
 eople's State of Bavaria\, he worked as a journalist in Marburg\, Nurember
 g\, and Munich. In the early 1890s\, Eisner served nine months in prison f
 or writing an article that attacked Kaiser Wilhelm II.\n\nIn 1918\, Eisner
  was convicted of treason for his role in inciting a strike of munitions w
 orkers. He spent nine months in Cell 70 of Stadelheim Prison\, but was rel
 eased during the General Amnesty in October of that year.\n\nFollowing his
  release from prison\, Eisner helped organize the revolution that overthre
 w the Bavarian monarchy\, declaring Bavaria to be a free state and republi
 c. Despite Eisner's socialist politics\, he explicitly distanced the movem
 ent from the Bolsheviks and promised to uphold property rights.\n\nOn Febr
 uary 21st\, 1919\, while on his way to deliver his resignation to Parliame
 nt\, Eisner was assassinated in Munich by a far-right German nationalist. 
 Eisner's murder made him a martyr for left-wing causes\, and a period of l
 awlessness in Bavaria followed his death.\n\nOn the night of April 6th-7th
 \, 1919\, communists\, encouraged by the news of the communist revolution

DESCRIPTION:Magnus Hirschfeld\, born on this day in 1868\, was a German ph
 ysician\, sexologist\, and feminist whose books were burned by the Nazis. 
 His work was among the earliest advocacy for homosexual and transgender ri
 ghts in the modern period\, according to historian Dustin Goltz.\n\nHirsch
 feld was born to a Jewish family in Kolberg\, Poland on May 14th\, 1868. A
 fter completing his studies\, Hirschfeld lived in the United States for ei
 ght months.\n\nWhile in Chicago\, Hirschfeld\, himself a homosexual\, note
 d a strong similarity between the gay subculture between that city and Ber
 lin\, leading him to a theory of universality of homosexuality in the huma
 n condition.\n\nHirschfeld became interested in gay rights because many of
  his gay patients took their own lives. He was struck by the number of his
  gay patients who had "Suizidalnarben" (scars left by suicide attempts)\, 
 and often found himself trying to give his patients a reason to live.\n\nD
 uring the Harden-Eulenburg affair of 1906-09\, a prominent sex scandal in 
 Imperial Germany\, Hirschfeld testified "homosexuality was part of the pla
 n of nature and creation just like normal love"\, causing a national scand
 al.\n\nHirschfeld developed a system which categorized 64 possible types o
 f sexual intermediary\, including those he described under the term "trans
 vestite"\, which he coined in 1910\, and those he described under the term
  "transsexuals"\, a term he coined in 1923. Hirschfeld and the Institute f
 or Sexual Sciences issued a number of transvestite passes to trans people 
 in order to prevent them from being harassed by the police.\n\nHirschfeld 
 co-wrote and acted in the 1919 film "Anders als die Andern" (English: "Dif
 ferent From the Others")\, in which Conrad Veidt played one of the first h
 omosexual characters ever written for cinema. The film had a specific gay 
 rights law reform agenda\; after Veidt's character is blackmailed by a mal
 e prostitute\, he eventually comes out rather than continuing to make the 
 blackmail payments. His career is destroyed and he is driven to suicide.\n
 \nLess than four months after the Nazis took power in 1933\, Hirschfeld's 
 Institute was sacked. On the morning of May 6th\, a group of university st
 udents who belonged to the National Socialist Student League stormed the i
 nstitution\, shouting "Burn Hirschfeld!" and began to beat up its staff an
 d smash up the premises.\n\nThe state seized the Institution's library and
  held a book burning event four days later. Berlin police arrived at the i
 nstitution and announced that it was closed forever. Hirschfeld\, out of t
 he country at the time\, became a political exile and never returned to Ge
 rmany.\n\nIn 1896\, one of Hirschfeld's patients\, a young army officer st
 ruggling with his homosexuality\, killed himself. In his suicide note\, th
 e officer stated: "The thought that you [Hirschfeld] could contribute a fu
 ture when the German fatherland will think of us in more just terms sweete
 ns the hour of my death."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1950\, a general strike in Nairobi\, Kenya bega
 n after two trade union leaders were arrested\, paralyzing airport travel 
 and public services and leading to the state arresting labor organizers en
  masse.\n\nThe Nairobi General Strike was the culmination of Kenya's post 
 war strike wave and urban upheaval\, also coming on the heels of a general
  strike in Mombasa in 1947\, led by the African Workers Federation (AWF).\
 n\nIn the decade leading up to the strike\, Nairobi's population more than
  doubled to at least 100\,000\, mostly attributable to wartime migration i
 nto the city. This was fueled by serious problems of landlessness in the K
 ikuyu reserves\, which were pushing out increasing numbers of ahoi. The la
 nd litigation cases that followed\, especially in Kiambu\, saw the losers 
 becoming either workers in their former lands\, now owned by the growing e
 lite of commercial farmers\, or simply leaving for Nairobi.\n\nOn the morn
 ing of May 15th\, Fred Kubai and Makhan Singh\, leaders in the East Africa
 n Trades Union Congress (EATCU)\, were arrested by and charged with being 
 officers of an unregistered trade union refusing to dissolve within the th
 ree month notification period.\n\nLater the same day\, members of the EATC
 U declared a general strike to begin on the 16th\, but by evening a genera
 l strike was already in effect all over Nairobi.\n\nThe strike paralyzed a
 irport travel\, public services\, and greatly limited commercial business.
  Strike leadership called off the action after a week's worth of protest\,
  disseminating a return-to-work order for May 25th.\n\nIn the aftermath of
  the strike\, the power of trade unions was diminished with the government
  arresting thousands of their members. Despite this setback\, the labor mo
 vement in Kenya was not broken and continued to gain momentum in the follo
 wing decade.

 by Naji al-Ali\; the keffiyeh\, a checkered black and white scarf worn aro

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1893\, the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) w
 as founded\, becoming a radical labor union that produced labor leaders su
 ch as Vincent St. John and "Big Bill" Haywood. The WFM later played a key 
 role in founding the IWW.\n\nIts efforts to organize both hard rock miners
  and smelter workers brought it into militant conflicts - often pitched ba
 ttles - with both employers and state authorities. The WFM was one of the 
 key factions in the Colorado Coal Wars.\n\nAlthough the WFM was always mil
 itant\, it did not adopt an explicitly socialist platform until 1901. "Big
  Bill" Haywood\, who had joined the WFM as a secretary\, was a prominent m
 ember during this period.\n\nThe WFM played a role in founding the Industr
 ial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905\, however the split between revolut
 ionaries and reformists led to the WFM withdrawing from the organization s
 everal years later and joining the American Federation of Labor (AFL).\n\n
 Because of this\, Haywood and notable labor leader Vincent St. John quit t
 he WFM and began channeling their efforts through the IWW instead.

 leaders who claimed that low social position was justified by karma.\n\nOn

DESCRIPTION:Daniel Guerin\, born on this day in 1904\, was a French libert
 arian communist and pioneering activist for queer liberation.\n\nBorn to a
  wealthy liberal Parisian family\, Guerin worked as a bookseller in Syria 
 and Lebanon in the late 1920s\, where he began to develop leftist sympathi
 es after witnessing the brutalities of French colonialism.\n\nAs a young m
 an\, Guerin also traveled across French Indochina\, visiting present-day V
 ietnam\, Cambodia\, and Laos. On the journey over\, he studied works by so
 cialist theorists\, including Marx\, Proudhon\, and Lenin.\n\nAfter return
 ing to France in 1930\, Guerin moved into a working class neighborhood and
  began writing for and directly involving himself with syndicalist and rev
 olutionary socialist groups. \n\nWhile initially drawn to Lenin and Trotsk
 y\, he soon came to reject vanguardism in favor of a more libertarian appr
 oach\, writing "I concluded…that socialism must rid itself of the fake n
 otion of the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' in order to rediscover its 
 libertarian authenticity".\n\nGuerin was also a committed anti-fascist. In
  his 1936 text "Fascism and Big Business"\, Guerin explores the connection
 s between the fascist regimes in Italy and Germany\, and their ties to loc
 al capitalist classes.\n\nIn 1940\, Guerin was detained by occupying Nazi 
 forces in Oslo. Upon release\, he managed to return to France in 1942.\n\n
 In the late 1940s\, Guerin spent some time residing in the United States\,
  continuing his writing there. He wrote of the American labor movement and
  the black liberation struggle more broadly.\n\nAlthough Guerin would ofte
 n directly relate his radicalization to his sexuality\, he lived much of h
 is life at a time when the workers' movement\, like society at large\, ten
 ded towards homophobic attitudes.\n\nIn 1955\, Guerin wrote a text on the 
 studies of American sexologist Alfred Kinsey where he began to openly argu
 e for change\, stating: "The vicious circle will only be broken when progr
 essive workers adopt both a more scientific and a more humane attitude tow
 ards homosexuality". \n\nFor this stance\, Guerin was attacked by many por
 tions of the left\, including the Communist Party of France (PCF). In 1965
 \, in rejection of his detractors\, Guerin came out\, becoming one of the 
 first openly gay communist figures in France.\n\nGuerin's politics continu
 ed to evolve\, and he would variously describe himself as either an anarch
 ist or a Libertarian Marxist. From 1955\, he was a member of the group Nou
 velle Gauche\, which would go throw a series of mergers before becoming pa
 rt of the Unified Socialist Party in 1960.\n\nIn 1963\, Guerin presented a
  report on workers' self-management to Ahmed Ben Bella\, the first Preside
 nt of Algeria following successful war for independence against France. He
  later opposed the military junta that overthrew Ben Bella in 1965.\n\nGue
 rin was an active participant of the May 68 uprising in France. Aside from
  the event's obvious broader political and revolutionary significance\, th
 is period marked an opening for significant changes in social attitudes - 
 including towards homosexuality. On May 68\, Guerin wrote "in contesting c
 lass society more broadly\, they’re [homosexuals] led to unmask their se
 xuality against the ‘hetero-police’ at the same time as they fight for
  the Revolution".\n\nAmong Guerin's works are Anarchism: From Theory to Pr
 actice\, No Gods No Masters: An Anthology of Anarchism\, Autobiography of 
 Youth\, and Fire in the Blood.\n\nGuerin continued writing and political a
 ctivity in later years\, joining the Union des Travailleurs Communistes Li
 bertaires. He remained a member until his death in 1988.\n\n"The fact that
  I am married\, a father\, a grandfather\, bisexual\, homosexual\, this ex
 plosive whole\, it seems to me that this is what I must leave behind as th
 e final expression of my life as a writer and as a man."\n\n- Daniel Gueri

 nth investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney found that evidence o
 f their innocence\, including FBI documents\, was withheld at trial.\n\nTh

 she thought Farrakhan had anything to do with her late husband's death. Sh

 , capitalist press vilified Malcolm X\, while media in Africa\, China\, an
 d Cuba lauded him as a hero and a martyr. The New York Times wrote that Ma
 lcolm X was "an extraordinary and twisted man" who "turn[ed] many true gif
 ts to evil purpose"\, while Time magazine condemned him "an unashamed dema
 gogue" whose "creed was violence."\n\nIn contrast\, The Ghanaian Times ide

 yred in freedom's cause." In China\, the People's Daily described him as a
  martyr killed by "ruling circles and racists" whose death illustrated tha
 t "in dealing with imperialist oppressors\, violence must be met with viol
 ence."\n\nIn 2023\, The Guardian reported that the Shabazz family announce
 d their plans to sue the FBI\, New York Police\, and other agencies over M
 alcom X's death. Ilyasah Shabazz\, the third daughter of Malcolm X and Bet
 ty Shabazz\, announced that new information indicates federal and state ag
 encies “conspired to and executed their plan to assassinate”. Ilyasah 
 added "For years\, our family has fought for the truth to come to light co
 ncerning his murder and we’d like our father to receive the justice that
  he deserves."\n\n"Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equali

 "
DESCRIPTION:François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture\, born on this day in
  1743\, was a Haitian general and leader of the Haitian Revolution\, the f
 irst successful slave revolution in the Americas. Haiti was the first coun
 try in the region to outlaw slavery.\n\nLouverture's participation in the 
 war was complex\, first fighting for the Spanish against the French\; then
  for France against Spain and Great Britain\; and finally\, he fought on b
 ehalf of independence for Saint-Domingue against the French.\n\nInitially\
 , Louverture was only supportive of fighting for better living conditions 
 for the enslaved\, but\, after committing to the full abolition of slavery
  in 1791\, he issued a proclamation at Camp Turel of St. Domingue: "Brothe
 rs and friends\, I am Toussaint Louverture\; perhaps my name has made itse
 lf known to you. I have undertaken vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality 
 to reign in St Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite yourselve
 s to us\, brothers and fight with us for the same cause."\n\nAs a revoluti
 onary leader\, Louverture's military and political acumen helped transform
  the fledgling slave rebellion into a revolutionary movement. He governed 
 Saint-Domingue with varying degrees of power for several years\, proclaimi
 ng an autonomous constitution for the colony in 1801 that declared himself
  its governor for life.\n\nLouverture was eventually tricked into being ar
 rested by Brunet\, a French General\, and deported to France\, where he di
 ed of unknown causes while imprisoned. Shortly thereafter\, the colony fin
 ally achieved independence under the leadership of Jean-Jacques Dessalines
 .\n\n"This gun is liberty\; hold for certain that the day when you no more
  have it\, you will be returned to slavery."\n\n- Toussaint Louverture

 working class politics and watershed moment in revolutionary anti-capitali
 st history\, was crushed by the French National Army. 20\,000 people were 
 killed and 44\,000 arrested.\n\nThe Paris Commune was a radical socialist 
 government that had formed in Paris a few months earlier\, on March 18th\,
  1871. The Commune developed a set of progressive\, secular\, and social d
 emocratic policies\, although its existence was too brief to implement all
  of them.\n\nAmong these policies were the separation of church and state\
 , abolition of child labor\, abolishment of interest on some forms of debt
 \, as well as the right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if
  it was deserted by its original owner.\n\nThe Commune was attacked by the
  French National Army on May 21st\, 1871\, beginning the so-called "Bloody
  Week" which defeated the revolutionary movement. After crushing the rebel
 lion\, the French government imprisoned approximately 44\,000 people for t
 heir role in the uprising. Estimated deaths from the fighting are around 2
 0\,000.\n\nThe Paris Commune was analyzed by many communist thinkers\, inc
 luding Karl Marx\, who identified it as a dictatorship of the proletariat.
  Vladimir Lenin danced in the snow when the newly formed Bolshevik governm
 ent lasted longer than the Paris Commune.\n\nThe episode inspired similar 
 revolutionary attempts around the world\, including in Moscow (1905)\, Pet
 rograd (1917)\, and Shanghai (1927 and 1967).

 as depressed\, citing how much junk food he consumed. This was pejorativel
 y dubbed the "Twinkie Defense".\n\nFollowing the announcement of White's c
 onviction\, members of San Francisco's gay community began marching in pro

  at City Hall. Protesters shouted "Kill Dan White!" and "Dump Dianne!"\, a
  reference to then Mayor Dianne Feinstein.\n\nSome protesters began breaki

 ticks. Protesters began setting police cruisers on fire. As one man ignite
 d a cop car\, he shouted to a reporter "Make sure you put in the paper tha
 t I ate too many Twinkies!" Sixty officers were injured and about two doze
 n arrests were made.\n\nLater that evening\, the police raided the predomi
 nantly gay Castro neighborhood\, invading the Elephant Walk bar and brutal
 izing its occupants. Police entered the bar yelling slurs\, shattering bar
  windows\, and attacking patrons. Other officers outside indiscriminately 
 attacked gays on the street.\n\nThe following day\, Supervisor Harry Britt
 \, who had replaced Milk\, refused to apologize for the riot: "Harvey Milk
 's people do not have anything to apologize for. Now the society is going 
 to have to deal with us not as nice little fairies who have hairdressing s

 Dan Whites anymore."\n\nJust a few months after the White Night Riots\, Di
 anne Feinstein was elected to a full term as San Francisco Mayor with some
  support from the gay community. One of her first actions in office was to
  appoint a new Chief of Police who oversaw the hiring of a more diverse po
 lice force. By 1980\, one in seven new police recruits was queer.\n\n"If a

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1919\, under the banner of the One Big Union (O
 BU)\, approximately 6\,500 miners in Alberta\, Canada walked off the job d
 uring a dispute over wages\, the cost of living allowance\, and working co
 nditions. The strike took place in the context of federal repression of la
 bor movements\; a few years earlier\, Canada had banned the similar Indust
 rial Workers of the World (IWW).\n\nAccordingly\, the striking workers fac
 ed violent repression from both the government and the coal operators. Aft
 er the walk-out continued more than a month\, coal operators received perm
 ission from the Northwest Mounted Police to hire "special constables" - in
  practice unemployed World War I veterans who were paid $10 a day\, plied 
 with free liquor\, and armed with brass knuckles and crowbars - to break u
 p the strike.\n\nStriking workers were attacked in their homes\, and worke
 rs who refused to act as scabs were driven 65-km out of town\, beaten\, an
 d left there. Strikers responded by forming self-defense militias that det
 erred constables form attacking them. The labor action was finally broken 
 after the federal government declared the OBU illegal and two strike leade
 rs were beaten\, tied to telephone poles\, and tarred and feathered in Aug
 ust of that year.\n\nDespite the immediate defeat\, the mere threat of mil
 itant industrial action allowed coal miners in Alberta to achieve massive 
 gains: the miners' day rate rose from $5.70 to $7.50 between 1919 and 1920
  and\, even after the strike had collapsed\, and the rate remained well ab
 ove inflation for a few years. These gains were eroded by 1924-25\, when s
 alaries were reduced back to the pre-strike levels.

  Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney when a car bomb beneath Judi's seat exploded

  of labor organizing and environmental activism in California by Bari.\n\n
 FBI bomb investigators were present on the scene of the bombing almost imm
 ediately\, leading some to speculate that the FBI either knew of the bombi
 ng or was directly involved in it. Bari was arrested for transporting expl
 osives while she was still in critical condition with a fractured pelvis a
 nd other major injuries. In 2002\, a federal jury found the FBI had violat
 ed Bari and Cherney's civil rights in the case\, and the pair was later aw
 arded a $4.4 million payout\, although Bari had died five years earlier.\n
 \nFBI analysis of the explosion dismissed the idea that the bomb was desig
 ned by Bari or Cherney. The identity of the bomber is still unknown. As fo

 \, and in November the pro-environment ballot initiative Proposition 130 w

 second degree murder\, following mass protests. On April 20th\, 2021\, Cha

 ssinated Symon Petliura\, President of the Ukrainian People's Republic and
  leader of its army\, for his role in Jewish pogroms\, stating "I have kil
 led a great assassin".\n\nAccording to Jewish historian Peter Kenez\, "bef
 ore the advent of Hitler\, the greatest mass murder of Jews occurs in the 
 Ukraine in the course of the Civil War. All participants in the conflict w
 ere guilty of murdering Jews\, even the Bolsheviks\; however the Volunteer
  Army had the largest number of victims."\n\nThe number of Jews killed dur

 1\,236 violent attacks on Jews had been recorded between 1918 and 1921 in 
 Ukraine.\n\nThe role of Petliura in those pogroms is controversial. While 
 Petliura actively sought to halt anti-Jewish violence on numerous occasion
 s\, including the punishment capital punishment for the crime of pogroming
 \, it is also documented that he was afraid to punish officers and soldier
 s engaged in crimes against Jews for fear of losing their support.\n\nSchw
 arzbard was a Jewish anarchist living in Paris\, becoming acquainted with 
 other anarchist activists who had emigrated from Russia and Ukraine\, incl

 May 25th\, 1926\, Schwarzbard approached Petliura and asked him in Ukraini
 an\, "Are you Mr. Petliura?" Petliura did not answer but raised his cane i

  by soldiers who claimed to be acting on orders from Petliura. After eight
  days\, Schwarzbard was acquitted.

 from the U.S. military government.\n\nIn 1946\, Lyuh represented the cente

DESCRIPTION:Amelia Bloomer\, born on this day in 1818\, was an early Ameri

 \n\nEven though Amelia did not create the "bloomers" clothing style\, a co
 mfortable alternative to the heavy\, constricting dresses women were expec
 ted to wear\, her name became associated with the style because of her ear
 ly and strong advocacy for them.\n\nBy publishing the magazine the "Lily"\
 , Bloomer became the first woman to own\, operate and edit a newspaper for
  women. The scholarly journal American Journalism described the magazine l
 ike this: "The issues addressed in the Lily—marital relations\, politica
 l representation\, property ownership\, education and work opportunities\,
  fair wages\, fashion customs\, women’s health\, religion\, and gendered
  social norms—reflected a broad-based agenda for feminism that is famili
 ar today. At the same time\, the journal’s privileging of middle-class w
 hite womanhood exposed fissures and blind spots related to race and class 
 that would reverberate for generations."\n\nAs an early advocate of women'
 s rights\, Bloomer was also responsible for introducing Susan B. Anthony a
 nd Elizabeth Cady Stanton to each other.\n\n"It will not do to say that it
  is out of woman's sphere to assist in making laws\, for if that were so\,
  then it should be also out of her sphere to submit to them."\n\n- Amelia

  "It seems that every heart that beats for freedom has no right than a bit
  of lead\, so I claim mine!"
DESCRIPTION:Louise Michel\, born on this day in 1830\, was a French anarch
 ist\, feminist\, educator\, author\, and militant leader of the Paris Comm
 une.\n\nBorn in 1830 as an illegitimate daughter and raised by her grandpa
 rents\, Louise Michel worked as a schoolteacher before revolution came to 
 Paris\, and\, in 1865\, opened a school dedicated to methods of progressiv
 e education.\n\nThere\, Michel came into contact with radical thinkers suc
 h as Jules Vallès and Auguste Blanqui\, and was concerned about the impov
 erishment of those on the margins of French society. In 1869\, she was one
  of the founding members of the "Society for the Demand of Civil Rights fo
 r Women"\, focused on improving girls' education.\n\nIn 1870\, war broke o
 ut between France and the Empire of Prussia. The war quickly ended in defe
 at for France\, and\, the following March\, discontented members of the Na
 tional Guard mutinied against the new national government in Paris\, marki
 ng the beginning of the working class uprising known as the Paris Commune.
 \n\nMichel joined the rebellion and was elected head of the Montmartre Wom
 en's Vigilance Committee\, playing an important role in the provisional re
 volutionary administration. She had a romantic relationship with Théophil
 e Ferré\, a senior member of the Commune's Committee of Public Safety.\n\
 nMichel personally fought on the front lines at the barricades\, also orga
 nizing ambulance stations to transport the wounded. She expressed a willin
 gness to sacrifice herself for the sake of revolution\, stating "I like th
 e smell of gunpowder\, grapeshot flying through the air\, but above all\, 
 I'm devoted to the Revolution."\n\nMichel survived the fall of the Commune
  and was brought to trial in December 1871. She dared the judges to senten
 ce her to death\, saying "It seems that every heart that beats for freedom
  has no other right than a bit of lead\, so I claim mine!"\n\nUnlike Ferr
 é\, who was executed\, she was instead punished by deportation to a penal
  settlement in the French colony of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.\n\
 nIn New Caledonia\, she became acquainted with the indigenous Kanak people
 \, and took an interest in their culture and language\, later supporting t
 hem during an 1878 revolt against French rule.\n\nMichel also befriended N
 athalie Lemel\, another exiled figure from the Commune\, and became an exp
 licit anarchist under her influence. In 1880\, amnesty was granted to form
 er Communards\, and Michel returned to Paris\, where she was greeted as a 
 hero by the downtrodden of the city and resumed her revolutionary activity
 .\n\nMichel later moved to London for five years\, where she ran a school 
 for children of political refugees\, and became a famed speaker across Eur
 ope\, meeting figures such as the Pankhurst sisters\, Peter Kropotkin\, an
 d Emma Goldman.\n\nIn 1904\, Michel embarked on an anti-colonial speaking 
 tour in French Algeria\, before falling ill shortly after. She died in Mar
 seille on January 9th\, 1905 at the age of 74. Her funeral was attended by
  over 100\,000 people\, receiving delegations from socialist and anarchist
  groups all across Europe.\n\nToday\, Michel remains one of the most famou
 s icons of the Paris Commune and is regarded as a pioneer of anarcha-femin
 ism.

 \n\nAlthough Bishop grew up in Grenada\, he left to study in London as a y

 d to Grenada and was active politically\, representing striking nurses in 
 court and leading the New Jewel Movement (NJM)\, a Marxist-Leninist vangua
 rd party. In 1979\, the NJM successfully led a coup against Eric Gairy and
  made Bishop the Prime Minister of Grenada.\n\nAmong Bishop's core princip
 les were workers' rights\, women's rights\, and the struggle against racis
 m and apartheid. Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave. Sex 
 discrimination was made illegal. Organizations for education\, health care
 \, youth affairs\, and literacy were also established. Due to his governme
 nt's efforts\, illiteracy and unemployment greatly declined.\n\nIn 1983\, 
 disputes within the party culminated in Bishop\, along with seven members 
 of his cabinet\, being captured and executed. After his assassination\, th
 e Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and Grenada's governor-g
 eneral Paul Scoon appealed to the United States to resolve the political s

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1831\, workers in the Welsh mining town of Mert
 hyr Tydfil initiated an uprising against the capitalist class\, reclaiming
  goods seized by debtors\, striking\, and flying the red flag as working c
 lass symbol for the first time.\n\nThe town of Merthyr Tydfil started beco
 ming a major industrial hub as early as the 18th century\, developing a cl
 ass of bourgeois "ironmasters"\, while the poor suffered from pollution\, 
 disease\, and work-related injuries. As economic crises in the late 1820s 
 worsened living conditions\, the people of Merthyr began to agitate for po
 litical change.\n\nReform-minded ironmaster William Crawshay co-founded th
 e "Political Union of Merthyr" in 1830 to fight for "democratic and humani
 tarian reforms"\, such as universal suffrage and parliamentary reform. Cra
 wshay also tried to keep his worker's wages high and produce a higher amou
 nt of iron than what the market demanded to expand his workforce.\n\nIn th
 e midst of an enduring economic crisis\, Crawshay began cutting wages in M
 arch 1831. In response\, workers abandoned the reformist Political Union a
 nd protesting en masse. In Merthyr\, huge crowds burned effigies of promin
 ent Tories in the streets\, called for opponents of Reform to be hanged\, 
 and known Tories found their windows smashed and their businesses looted.\
 n\nOn May 23rd\, dozens of miners and "puddlers" (those known for particip
 ating in political agitation) received new\, deeper wage cuts\, and 84 wer
 e dismissed altogether.\n\nA week later\, on May 30th\, 1831\, workers ass
 embled at Waum Common\, where they made speeches\, carried banners and for
 mulated demands\, marking the beginning of the Rising. Despite the spontan
 eous and leaderless character of the protests\, a four-point program emerg
 ed: abolition of the Court of Requests\, the abolition of debt imprisonmen
 t\, new laws against price gouging\, and no hiring of new miners on lower 
 wages than their predecessors.\n\nThe following day\, workers reclaimed go
 ods that had been seized by debtors. Protestors marched to the mines\, whe
 re they convinced those still working to join the resistance. A general st
 rike broke out\, and workers effectively seized control of Merthyr Tydfil\
 , a key engine of British industrial production.\n\nWith Crawshay's help\,
  the army was soon dispatched in order to restore state control\, but\, fi
 nding themselves outnumbered by an armed citizenry\, soldiers were forced 
 to fall back. Rebels defeated successive military units before the rebelli
 on was finally put down on April 7th.

 t necessarily be a central bank\, and where such a bank exists\, the paras
 itic Jewish nation\, speculating with the labor of the people\, will be fo
 und."\n\nBakunin biographer Mark Leier wrote that "Bakunin had a significa

 rebels were crushed by state forces. Most of the rebel leaders were tracke

  The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years' War\, by d
 eterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for milita

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1906\, revolutionary anarchist Mateu Morral att
 empted to assassinate Spanish King Alfonso XIII and his bride via bomb. Th
 e attack failed\, killing 24 bystanders\, and caused state persecution of 
 other anarchists.\n\nMateu Morral was a young\, wealthy anarchist who had 
 recently worked at Escuela Moderna\, an anarchist school in Barcelona\, Sp
 ain\, founded and ran by Francisco Ferrer. In the weeks leading up to the 
 attack\, Mateu took a leave of absence from the school\, citing illness.\n
 \nOn May 31st\, 1906\, Mateu Morral threw a bomb\, obscured in a bouquet o
 f flowers\, from a hotel balcony at King Alfonso XIII's car as he returned
  with his bridge Victoria Eugenie from their wedding in Madrid. While the 
 King and Queen were unscathed\, 24 bystanders and soldiers were killed\, a
 nd over 100 more wounded.\n\nMorral fled the scene and sought refuge from 
 Republican (although explicitly anti-anarchist) journalist José Nakens. N
 akens reluctantly gave Morral shelter\, but Mateu grew mistrustful the sam
 e night and fled. A few days later\, he was discovered at a Madrid railway
  station and killed a police officer and himself rather than be taken into
  custody.\n\nAuthorities used the 1906 regicide attempt as a pretext to su
 ppress Ferrer and his educational work. Ferrer was arrested within a week 
 of the attack and charged with both its organization and recruiting of Mor
 ral. He was imprisoned for a year while prosecutors pursued evidence for h
 is trial\, and was ultimately acquitted.\n\nModern historians disagree to 
 the extent of Ferrer's involvement. Historian of anarchism Paul Avrich has
  stated "Barring the discovery of conclusive evidence\, Ferrer's role in t
 he Morral affair must remain an open question."\n\nFerrer was executed by 
 the Spanish government three years later\, after a farcical trial convicte
 d him of orchestrating a period of insurrection known as Barcelona's "Trag
 ic Week".

COMMENT:On this day in 1921\, the Tulsa Race Massacre began when mobs of w
 hite people attacked residents and businesses of the Greenwood District\,

 k families homeless.
DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1921\, the Tulsa Race Massacre began when mobs 
 of white people attacked residents and businesses of the Greenwood Distric
 t\, known as "Black Wall Street"\, killing hundreds and rendering 10\,000 
 black families homeless.\n\nHistorian Scott Ellsworth called it "the singl
 e worst incident of racial violence in American history"\, with estimates 
 ranging from 75-300 people killed\, 800 wounded\, and 10\,000 black famili
 es made homeless from the destruction of property.\n\nThe massacre began o
 ver Memorial Day weekend after 19-year-old Dick Rowland\, a black shoeshin
 er\, was accused of assaulting Sarah Page\, the 17-year-old white elevator
  operator of the nearby Drexel Building. When a lynch mob formed at the ja
 il\, an armed group of black men showed up to counter it.\n\nShots rang ou
 t when a white person tried to disarm one of the black men. The initial vi
 olence left ten people dead\, and a mob of enraged white people stormed bl
 ack neighborhoods\, indiscriminately killing families\, setting fires\, an
 d destroying property.\n\nAs crews from the Tulsa Fire Department arrived 
 to put out fires\, they were turned away at gunpoint. One account stated "
 It would mean a fireman's life to turn a stream of water on one of those n
 egro buildings. They shot at us all morning when we were trying to do some
 thing but none of my men was hit. There is not a chance in the world to ge
 t through that mob into the negro district."\n\nSeveral eyewitnesses descr
 ibed airplanes carrying white assailants\, who fired rifles and dropped fi
 rebombs on buildings\, homes\, and fleeing families. The privately owned a
 ircraft had been dispatched from the nearby Curtiss-Southwest Field outsid
 e Tulsa. Law enforcement officials later claimed that the planes were to p
 rovide reconnaissance and protect against a "Negro uprising".\n\nMultiple 
 eyewitness accounts said that on the morning of June 1st\, at least a doze
 n planes circled the neighborhood and dropped "burning turpentine balls" o
 n an office\, a hotel\, a filling station\, and other buildings.\n\nFor 75
  years (until 1996)\, the massacre was almost totally omitted from local\,
  state\, and national histories. It was not recognized in the Tulsa Tribun
 e feature of "Fifteen Years Ago Today" or "Twenty-Five Years Ago Today". A
  2017 report detailing the history of the Tulsa Fire Department from 1897 
 until the date of publication made no mention of the 1921 mass arson.\n\nI
 n 2015\, a previously unknown written eyewitness account of the Tulsa Race
  Massacre from attorney Buck Colbert Franklin was discovered. Franklin wro
 te: "The sidewalks were literally covered with burning turpentine balls. I
  knew all too well where they came from\, and I knew all too well why ever
 y burning building first caught fire from the top...I paused and waited fo
 r an opportune time to escape. 'Where oh where is our splendid fire depart
 ment with its half dozen stations?' I asked myself\, 'Is the city in consp
 iracy with the mob?'"

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1906\, Mexican employees of the US-owned Canane
 a Copper Company went on strike\, demanding an end to pay discrimination a
 nd an eight-hour day. The strike's repression was a key precursor to the M
 exican Revolution of 1910.\n\nThe Cananea Consolidated Copper Company (CCC
 C) was owned by American Colonel William Greene\, whose capitalist enterpr
 ise was greatly aided by the corrupt Mexican government of Porfirio Díaz.
  CCCC employed both American and Mexican workers\, however senior position
 s could only be held by Americans and Mexicans were paid 3.5 pesos a day t
 o the Americans' 5.\n\nCananea was a company town in which workers were fo
 rced to live in company housing and buy necessities at the company store. 
 Despite this\, the wages offered to Mexican workers were among the highest
  in the region\, making the jobs competitive.\n\nOn June 1st\, 1906\, near
 ly all of the Mexican employees of CCCC went on strike. Among their demand
 s were an end to pay discrimination\, an eight hour day (down from ten)\, 
 and a guaranteed representation of Mexicans in the workforce. One slogan w
 as "Ocho horas! cinco pesos!" (eight hours\, five pesos).\n\nThe company f
 latly rejected all of the workers' demands\, and thousands of laborers beg
 an to march in protest. Upon arriving at the company's lumber yard\, prote
 sters were hosed down by armed management. Violence broke out\, and three 
 workers and both managers were killed\, the latter stabbed to death with m
 ining implements. Workers then set fire to the lumber yard\, causing ~$100
 \,000 in damages.\n\nThe strike devolved into a de facto war after deputiz
 ed company men fired on workers approaching the local bank\, jail\, and co
 mpany store. The crowd\, mostly unarmed\, raided local pawnshops for weapo
 ns and proceeded to engage in firefights with a combined force of Mexican 
 Federal Troops\, 275 volunteers from Arizona\, and CCCC forces.\n\nEstimat
 es of casualties vary\, but at least 23 were killed and more than 50 were 
 arrested before the workers were defeated. Green blamed the uprising on "a
  Socialistic organization that has been formed by malcontents opposed to t
 he Díaz government."\; literature of the pro-labor Partido Liberal Mexica
 no (PLM) was found in the workers' settlements.\n\nThe Cananea Riot became
  linked with the Río Blanco Strike of January 1907 as symbols of Díaz's 
 corruption and subservience to foreign capital. According to historian Les
 lie Bethell\, both became "household words for hundreds of thousands of Me
 xicans". Díaz would be forced to resign in 1911.\n\nThe mine in Cananea c
 urrently continues to be worked for copper and was subject to a miners' st
 rike as recently as 2008.

DESCRIPTION:Adelaide Casely-Hayford\, born on this day in 1868\, was a Sie
 rra Leone Creole Pan-African feminist\, educator\, and author. Hayford est
 ablished a vocational school for young girls in Sierra Leone that emphasiz
 ed racial and cultural pride.\n\nHayford was born into an elite Sierra Leo
 ne family in Freetown\, British Sierra Leone. She spent much of her youth 
 in England and studying throughout the West\, also studying music in Germa
 ny at the age of 17.\n\nWhile in England\, Adelaide married West African a
 uthor and Pan-Africanist J. E. Casely Hayford (also known as Ekra-Agiman).
  Their marriage may have influenced her transformation into a cultural nat
 ionalist.\n\nIn May 1914\, Hayford returned to Sierra Leone\, dedicating t
 he rest of her life to educating African girls. In October 1923\, she esta
 blished the Girls' Vocational School\, one of the first educational instit
 utions in Sierra Leone to provide young girls with an African-centered edu
 cation\, according to historian Keisha N. Blain.\n\nHayford frequently tra
 veled throughout the world\, giving a speaking tour in the United States o
 n misconceptions about Africa. Author Brittany Rogers notes that these tra
 vels also exposed her to the exploitation of black female labor throughout
  the world.\n\nAlthough her educational concept for young girls had a Vict
 orian-influenced\, middle class domesticity in mind\, Rogers writes that t
 hese travels led Hayford to begin writing and speaking on matters of labor
  as well. Hayford died in her hometown of Freetown\, Sierra Leone in 1960.
 \n\n"Instantly my eyes were opened to the fact that the education meted ou
 t to [African people] had...taught us to despise ourselves. Our immediate 
 need was an education which would instill into us a love of country\, a pr
 ide of race\, an enthusiasm for the black man's capabilities\, and a genui
 ne admiration for Africa's wonderful art work."

 \, although they were also racialized\, with L.A. Councilman Norris Nelson
  stating "the zoot suit has become a badge of hoodlumism".\n\nThe riots be
 gan on the night of June 3rd when ~12 sailors and a group of young Mexican
 s in zoot suits began fighting. The LAPD responded to the incident "seekin
 g to clean up Main Street from what they viewed as the loathsome influence
  of pachuco gangs"\, according to historian Luis Alvarez. The police arres
 ted the sailors and not the Mexicans.\n\nThe next day\, 200 sailors headed
  for East Los Angeles\, a Mexican-American part of town\, and attacked and
  stripped everyone they came across who were wearing zoot suits. Local pre
 ss heralded the violence as cleaning up the town\, and soon thousands of s
 ailors joined the riot. Journalist Carey McWilliams described what happene
 d like this:\n\n"Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles\, a 
 mob of several thousand soldiers\, sailors\, and civilians\, proceeded to 
 beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the import
 ant motion picture theaters\, the mob ordered the management to turn on th
 e house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out o
 f their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans\, and some Filipinos 
 and Negroes\, were jerked from their seats\, pushed into the streets and b
 eaten with a sadistic frenzy."\n\nThe L.A. City Council approved a resolut
 ion criminalizing zoot suits\, although the ordinance was not signed into 
 law. The Navy and Marine Corps Staff prohibited sailors from traveling to 
 L.A. in an effort to curb the violence\, however they officially maintaine
 d that the men were acting in self-defense.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1835\, the first recorded general strike in Nor
 th America broke out in Philadelphia when striking Irish dock workers were
  joined by city workers. A wave of successful strikes followed\, standardi
 zing the 10 hour day.\n\nThe strike involved around 20\,000 workers\, dema
 nding a ten-hour workday and increased wages. The strike ended in complete
  victory for the workers.\n\nInfluenced by labor agitation in Boston\, the
  Philadelphia General Strike began with unskilled Irish workers on the Sch
 uylkill River coal wharves going out on strike for a ten-hour day. The doc
 k workers patrolled the picket line with swords\, threatening any scab who
  attempted to unload coal from the 75 vessels waiting in the water.\n\nThe
  coal heavers were soon joined by workers from many other trades\, includi
 ng leather dressers\, printers\, carpenters\, bricklayers\, masons\, house
  painters\, bakers\, and city employees.\n\nOn June 6th\, a mass meeting o
 f workers\, lawyers\, doctors\, and a few businessmen\, was held in the St
 ate House courtyard. The meeting unanimously adopted a set of resolutions 
 giving full support to the workers' demand for wage increases and a shorte
 r workday\, as well as increased wages for women workers and a boycott of 
 any coal merchant who worked his men more than ten hours.\n\nThe strike qu
 ickly came to a close after city public works employees joined the labor a
 ction. The Philadelphia city government announced that the "hours of labor
  of the working men employed under the authority of the city corporation w
 ould be from 'six to six' during the summers season\, allowing one hour fo
 r breakfast\, and one for dinner."\n\nOn June 22nd\, three weeks after the
  coal heavers initially struck\, the ten-hour system and an increase in wa
 ges for piece-workers was adopted in the city. A wave of successful strike
 s across the United States followed this victory. By the end of 1835\, the
  ten-hour day had become the standard for most day city laborers.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1967\, the Israeli Army occupied the West Bank 
 and Gaza Strip\, claiming emergency powers with a military decree that gre
 atly restricts the rights of the occupied. The ongoing occupation is the l
 ongest in the modern era.\n\nThe Israeli Army action took place in the con
 text of the Six Day War\, fought between Israel and a coalition of Arab st
 ates. The status of the West Bank as a militarily occupied territory has b
 een affirmed by the International Court of Justice and\, with the exceptio
 n of East Jerusalem\, by the Israeli Supreme Court.\n\nAccording to Human 
 Rights Watch (HRW)\, the military proclamation issued by the Israeli Army 
 on June 7th\, 1967 permitted the application of the Defense (Emergency) Re
 gulations of 1945.\n\nThese regulations empowered\, and continue to empowe
 r\, authorities to declare as an "unlawful association" groups that advoca
 te for "bringing into hatred or contempt\, or the exciting of disaffection
  against" the authorities\, and criminalize membership in or possession of
  material belonging to or affiliated\, even indirectly\, with these groups
 .\n\nHRW goes on to state that these and other broad restrictions on the o
 ccupied population violate international law: "The Israeli army has for ov
 er 50 years used broadly worded military orders to arrest Palestinian jour
 nalists\, activists and others for their speech and activities - much of i
 t non-violent - protesting\, criticizing or opposing Israeli policies. The
 se orders are written so broadly that they violate the obligation of state
 s under international human rights law to clearly spell out conduct that c
 ould result in criminal sanction."\n\nFollowing the military occupation of
  the West Bank\, Israel began expropriating the land and facilitating Isra
 eli settlements in the area\, broadly considered a violation of internatio
 nal law. While Israelis in the West Bank are subject to Israeli law and gi
 ven representation in the Israeli Knesset\, Palestinian civilians\, mostly
  confined to scattered enclaves\, are subject to martial law and are not p
 ermitted to vote in Israel's national elections.\n\nThis two-tiered system
  has inspired comparisons to apartheid\, likening the dense disconnected p
 ockets that Palestinians are relegated to with the segregated Bantustans t
 hat previously existed in South Africa when the country was still under wh
 ite supremacist rule.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1968\, all 187 women employees working at a For

  equal work\, eventually leading to the Equal Pay Act of 1970.\n\nAt the f

 , paid both less than "skilled" (Category C) workers and Category B male w
 orkers. Even teenage boys sweeping the floors were paid more than the wome
 n working there.\n\nIn response to this\, all 187 women went on strike on 
 June 7th\, demanding equal pay for equal work. Despite their labor being c
 lassified as unskilled\, car production halted within a week. The factory 
 was forced to come to a complete standstill\, eventually costing the compa
 ny over $8 million. Despite this\, Ford refused to negotiate.\n\nThe strik
 e ended after Barbara Castle\, the Secretary of State for Employment and P
 roductivity\, intervened\, beginning a set of negotiations at which men we
 re not allowed. The strike ended with an immediate increase of their rate 
 of pay to 8% below that of men\, rising to the full Category B rate the fo
 llowing year. In 1984\, following an additional strike\, the women were ca
 tegorized as Category C.\n\nThe labor action is considered key to the pass

 en and women in Britain in terms of pay and conditions of employment. In 1
 978\, despite its passage\, women's relative position in the UK was still

 shut down the power plant that served both the company's mines and the cit

  New Waterford citizens\, but the miners drew on local wells and set up a 
 volunteer service to deliver water to the hospital.\n\nOn June 11th\, a fo

 , possibly more than 2\,000 in number\, marched to Waterford Lake in prote

 ear old William Davis.\n\nThis annual commemoration to all miners killed i

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1901\, under duress of occupation by the United
  States military\, the newly independent Cuban government ratified the Pla
 tt Amendment\, giving the U.S. legal control over the Cuban state and econ
 omy.\n\nThe occupying force had remained in Cuba following the conclusion 
 of the Spanish-American War\, and the U.S. government refused to withdraw 
 occupying troops from Cuba until the seven conditions of the Platt Amendme
 nt were ratified in the new Cuban constitution.\n\nThese conditions define
 d the terms of Cuban-U.S. relations to be an unequal one of U.S. dominance
  over Cuba\, both politically and economically. Among these provisions wer
 e the government of Cuba consenting to the right of the United States to "
 intervene for the preservation of Cuban independence\, the maintenance of 
 a government adequate for the protection of life\, property\, and individu
 al liberty".\n\nFollowing acceptance of the amendment\, the United States 
 ratified a tariff that gave Cuban sugar preference in the U.S. market and 
 protection to select U.S. products in the Cuban market. Over $200 million 
 was spent by American companies on Cuban sugar between 1903 and 1913\, and
  this investment into sugar led to land being concentrated into the hands 
 of the largest sugar mills\, with estimates that 20% of all Cuban land was
  owned by these mills.

DESCRIPTION:Ernesto "Che" Guevara\, born on this day in 1928\, was an Arge
 ntine communist revolutionary\, physician\, military leader\, and author w
 ho fought in the guerilla war against Fulgencio Batista and helped lead th
 e new communist government.\n\nErnesto was born to an upper-class Argentin
 e family of pre-independence Spanish (i.e. Basque and Cantabrian) and Iris
 h ancestry. Referring to Che's restless nature\, his father noted "the fir
 st thing to note is that in my son's veins flowed the blood of the Irish r
 ebels".\n\nIn 1950 and 1951\, he embarked on two continent-wide motorcycle
  journeys throughout South and Central America\, observing poverty and poo
 r working conditions that left a deep impression on his worldview. He late
 r published a memoir of these experiences called "The Motorcycle Diaries"\
 , dubbed by Verso Books as "Das Kapital meets Easy Rider".\n\nIn 1956\, Ch
 e Guevara sailed to Cuba to aid in the struggle against Batista\, narrowly
  surviving an attack by Batista's forces after they landed on the island. 
 He became a major figure of the Cuban Revolution\, promoted by Fidel Castr
 o to Comandante of a second army column.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Revolution
 's success\, Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government
 . These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads for those convict
 ed as war criminals during the revolutionary tribunals\, instituting agrar
 ian land reform\, helping spearhead a successful nationwide literacy campa
 ign\, serving as both national bank president and instructional director f
 or Cuba's armed forces\, and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf 
 of Cuban socialism.\n\nGuevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment revolution abro
 ad\, first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia\, where h
 e was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and summarily executed.\n\n
 "At the risk of seeming ridiculous\, let me say that the true revolutionar

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 2017\, the deadliest UK residential fire since 
 WWII began in Grenfell Tower\, West London. 72 people\, including children
  as young as six months old\, were killed. As of 2022\, no one has been ch
 arged for the residents' deaths. More than 70 others were injured and 223 
 people escaped.\n\nThe high rise apartment complex\, managed by Kensington
  and Chelsea TMO (KCTMO) was home to working class residents\, many of the
 m immigrants. Grenfell Tower was 24 stories tall and 120 flats in total.\n
 \nIn the years leading up to the fire\, residents and neighborhood groups 
 made multiple complaints about the unsafe state of the complex. In 2016\, 
 Grenfell Action Group (GAG) warned that people might be trapped in the bui
 lding if a fire broke out. Later that year\, they stated "only a catastrop
 hic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of [KCTMO]...They ca
 n't say that they haven't been warned!"\n\nTwo women living in Grenfell To
 wer\, Mariem Elgwahry and Nadia Choucair\, were threatened with legal acti
 on by KCTMO after they campaigned for improved fire safety. Both later die
 d in the fire\, at the ages of 27 and 33\, respectively.\n\nEarly on June 
 14th\, 2017\, the Grenfell Tower Fire began with a malfunctioning freezer 
 on the fourth floor. Because the building did not meet safety regulations\
 , fire spread rapidly up the building's exterior\, bringing fire and smoke
  to all residential floors.\n\nEyewitnesses reported seeing some people ju
 mping to their deaths. Some of these deaths were classed as suicides despi
 te being a direct consequence of the fire. Frequent explosions from gas li
 nes (which residents claimed were unsafely exposed just months earlier) in
  the building were reported.\n\nA public inquiry\, ordered by then Prime M
 inister Theresa May\, is ongoing as of June 14th\, 2022. Despite a 2017 st
 atement from British police stating that they had "reasonable grounds" to 
 suspect corporate manslaughter "may have been committed"\, no criminal cha
 rges have been filed.\n\nWhile justice for Grenfell Tower residents has be
 en delayed\, the British government has found the means to charge at least
  twenty-one people with fraud relating to damage claims regarding the fire
 .\n\nEdward Daffam\, a member of GAG\, has stated: "They didn't give a stu
 ff about us. We were the carcass and they were the vultures. North Kensing
 ton was like a goldmine\, only they didn't have to dig for the gold. All t
 hey had to do was to marginalise the people who were living here\, and tha

  theologians and abolitionists\, such as Henry Ward Beecher\, Charles Beec
 her\, and Edward Beecher.\n\nHarriet's own politics were influenced by dir

 d 1830s\, as well as the Lane Debates on Slavery\, which led to the foundi
 ng of Oberlin College after a mass exodus of students from Lane Theologica
 l Seminary.\n\nLater in life\, she was an outspoken critic of slavery and 
 supported the Underground Railroad\, temporarily housing several fugitive 
 slaves in her home. It was during this period\, in the decade before the C
 ivil War\, that she authored "Uncle Tom's Cabin". Within a year of its pub
 lication\, the book sold an unprecedented 300\,000 copies and was widely r
 ead in both the United States and Great Britain.\n\nHarriet Stowe was also
  an early feminist thinker\, connecting the struggle for black liberation 
 to the struggle for women's liberation more broadly\, writing in 1869 that
  "the position of a married woman...is\, in many respects\, precisely simi
 lar to that of the negro slave. She can make no contract and hold no prope
 rty\; whatever she inherits or earns becomes at that moment the property o
 f her husband...Though he acquired a fortune through her\, or though she e
 arned a fortune through her talents\, he is the sole master of it\, and sh

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1953\, in what became an uprising of more than 
 one million people\, 300 East German construction workers protested at gov
 ernment buildings\, demanding the reversal of a 10% increase in work quota
 s.\n\nDue to an economic slump\, the East German government had increased 
 worker quotas (called "norms") by 10% across all state-owned factories. At
  the same time\, the prices of food\, health care\, and public transportat
 ion had all significantly increased\, leading to an effective monthly wage
  cut of 33%\, according to historian Corey Ross.\n\nAlthough the governmen
 t quickly conceded on the matter of work quotas\, the protests took on an 
 anti-government character and spread quickly throughout all of East German
 y. News of the initial strike had spread both through word of mouth and th
 e Western "Radio in the American Sector" (RIAS)\, which provided sympathet
 ic coverage of the protests.\n\nSoviet troops and tanks entered East Berli
 n on the morning of June 17th and violently clashed with the protesters\, 
 who had stormed government headquarters. The East German Stasi engaged in 
 mass arrests of thousands of people.\n\nAccording to historian Richard Mil
 lington\, around 39 people were killed during the uprising\, the vast majo
 rity of them demonstrators. Seven Berlin victims were given an official st
 ate funeral in West Berlin on June 23rd\, 1953.\n\nFollowing the uprising'
 s successful repression\, many workers lost faith in East Germany's social
 ist state. According to historian Gareth Pritchard\, there was a widesprea
 d refusal by workers to pay their trade union dues and support the ruling 
 party.\n\nIn response to the incident\, the East German state expanded its
  surveillance of workers to more closely monitor discontent\, creating wha
 t journalist Chris Hedges called "the most efficient security and surveill
 ance state" of its time.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1976\, the Soweto Uprising began in South Afric
 a after the government mandated that Afrikaans be taught in school\, leadi
 ng to demonstrations by more than 20\,000 black schoolchildren\, hundreds 
 of whom were killed by police.\n\nThe Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974 mand
 ated all black schools to use Afrikaans and English in equal amounts as la
 nguages of instruction. Afrikaans was strongly associated with apartheid (
 prominent anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu called it "the language of 
 the oppressor")\, and this decree was widely resented.\n\nAt first\, resis
 tance to the measure was scattered - on April 30th\, the students of Orlan
 do West Junior School went on strike\, and other schools began to follow s
 uit. Students eventually formed an Action Committee\, later known as the S
 oweto Students' Representative Council\, which organized a mass meeting on
  June 13th to develop a cohesive strategy of protest.\n\nOn the morning on
  June 16th\, 10\,000-20\,000 students walked out of their schools to a mas
 s rally\, carrying signs reading "Down with Afrikaans"\, "Viva Azania"\, a
 nd "If we must do Afrikaans\, Vorster must do Zulu".\n\nThe protest turned
  violent after students killed a trained dog that the police had sicced on
  them\, causing the police to open fire. Among the first students to be mu
 rdered were the 15-year-old Hastings Ndlovu and the 12-year-old Hector Pie
 terson (shown\, photo by Sam Nzima).\n\nSocial reformer Dr. Melville Edels
 tein was beaten to death by the mob\, a sign around his neck proclaiming\,
  "Beware Afrikaans is the most dangerous drug for our future". 23 people d
 ied on the first day in Soweto\, and hundreds more were killed in the foll
 owing weeks.\n\nEmergency clinics were swamped with injured and bloody chi
 ldren. Police requested for the hospital to provide a list of all victims 
 with bullet wounds\, however the doctors refused\, recording bullet wounds
  as abscesses.\n\nThe violence led to widespread riots and sympathy protes
 ts throughout South Africa\, including white students from the University 
 of the Witwatersrand. In remembrance of these events\, June 16th is now a 
 public holiday in South Africa known as Youth Day.

DESCRIPTION:Angelo Sbardellotto was an Italian anarchist executed by the s
 tate on this day in 1932 for plotting to assassinate Benito Mussolini. He 
 refused to beg for clemency\, instead telling the court he regretted not s
 ucceeding in his plan.\n\nSbardellotto was born into a poor family who was
  compelled to emigrate to find work. Angelo and his father left Italy in O
 ctober 1924\, living in France\, Luxembourg\, and Belgium\, where Angelo w
 orked as a miner and a machine hand.\n\nWhile working as a miner\, he join
 ed the anarchist committee of Liege\, and was active in the activities to 
 bring about the general strike in Belgium in solidarity with framed Italia
 n-American anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti.\n\nAlready under surveillance as
  a suspected communist subversive\, Sbardellotto was stopped by police in 
 Piazza Venezia\, Rome in 1932\, found armed with two rudimentary bombs and
  a pistol\, as well as possession of a Swiss passport.\n\nAdmitting to hav
 ing entered Italy clandestinely with the intent of avenging socialist Mich
 ael Schirru by killing Mussolini (Schirru himself had attempted to assassi
 nate Mussolini)\, Sbardellotto was interrogated and likely tortured by pol
 ice before his trial a week later on June 11th.\n\nWhen Sbardellotto's law
 yer requested that he write to Mussolini directly to ask for his life to b
 e spared\, he refused\, stating that he was only sorry that he had not car
 ried out the attempt on Mussolini.\n\nOn June 17th\, 1932\, at twenty-four
  years old\, he was put in front of the firing squad at the Bretta Fort. H
 e refused last rites from a priest. Angelo's last words before being shot 
 were "Long live anarchy!"

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1896\, nearly 1\,000 miners of the Western Fede
 ration of Miners (WFM) walked off the job for higher wages\, causing a loc
 kout that shut down all mines in the district and the WFM to turn to revol
 utionary socialist politics.\n\nThe Leadville miners' strike was initiated
  by the Cloud City Miners' Union\, the Leadville\, Colorado local of the W
 estern Federation of Miners (WFM)\, against those silver mines paying thei
 r workers less than $3.00 per day\, approximately $32 in 2021 American cur
 rency. The action was taken after a near unanimous vote from more than 1\,
 000 miners the same day.\n\nOn June 22nd\, mine owners in the area banded 
 together\, agreeing to a district-wide worker lockout and signing a secret
  agreement to maintain a unified front against the union: none of them wou
 ld recognize the union or negotiate with it\, and that no participant woul
 d agree to any concessions except by majority vote of the owners.\n\nLeadv
 ille mine owner John Campion hired labor spies from both the Thiel Detecti
 ve Agency and the Pinkerton Agency to spy on the union. Campion hired addi
 tional spies to report on activities of replacement workers imported from 
 Missouri. The owners used their spies to develop a blacklist and exploit d
 ivisions among the striking workers.\n\nAt the time the WFM was associated
  with the American Federation of Labor (AFL)\, a more moderate union. Othe
 r WFM locals\, particularly the Butte\, Montana local\, sent financial sup
 port to the strikers\, but the AFL refused to provide both financial suppo
 rt and to call other union locals out in sympathy strikes.\n\nOn September
  21st\, a group of approximately 50 armed strikers began a series of pre-m
 editated attacks on mines in the area\, attempting to destroy them with bo
 mbs and a homemade cannon. Four miners\, all found to be members of the WF
 M\, were killed\, along with one fireman. This led to widespread arrests o
 f WFM members and the arrival of the National Guard to the area.\n\nThe st
 rike was defeated on March 9th\, 1897. The failure of the strike to succee
 d caused the WFM to leave the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and turn 
 towards more radical anti-capitalist politics. The WFM would go on to play
  a key role in founding the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905.

  striking coal miners looted ammunition and guns from a hardware store and

 mine to remain open and for miners to go back to work\, as long as no coal
  was shipped out.\n\nBy June\, over 60\,000 tons of coal had been dug up a

  firearms and ammunition\, and laid siege to the mine.\n\nThe strikebreake
 rs working in the mine surrendered to the union workers firing on them and
  were captured as prisoners. Despite promises of safety\, they were brutal
 ly tortured and massacred by the union miners.\n\nSix strikebreakers were 
 ordered to remove their shirts and shoes and told to crawl to Herrin Cemet
 ery. A large crowd watched as the scabs were roped together\, and union me
 n took turns beating\, shooting them\, and urinating on them.\n\nIn total\
 , twenty-three workers were killed\, most of whom were members of the stri
 kebreaking group. W.J. Lester\, the owner of the mine\, made a significant
  sum from selling his mine after the massacre occurred.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1877\, ten members of the Molly Maguires\, a se

 ere executed in Pennsylvania on the basis of dubious evidence from an unde
 rcover Pinkerton agent.\n\nAfter the Great Panic of 1873\, Pennsylvania mi
 ne owners imposed a new contract on the workforce which lowered pay rates 
 by 10-20%. This led to the Long Strike of 1875\, which lasted seven months
  and compelled the governor order in troops to the region.\n\nWhen the Lon
 g Strike failed\, some Irish-American miners turned to tactics that had be
 en employed in Ireland in the late 17th and 18th centuries\, using oath bo
 und societies\, anonymous threats and in some cases violent retribution on
  those deemed hostile to their community. The Molly Maguires emerged from 
 this historical backdrop.\n\nIn 1876-77\, twenty suspected Molly Maguires 
 were convicted of murder and other crimes on the basis of dubious evidence
  (mostly testimony from notorious Pinkerton Agent James McParland).\n\nOn 
 June 21st\, 1877\, six of the convicted men were hanged in the prison at P
 ottsville\, and four at Mauch Chunk\, Carbon County (modern day Jim Thorpe
 \, Pennsylvania). American labor historian Philip Foner concluded that the
  men were likely framed due to their labor activism.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1866\, the U.S. government put up approximately
  46 million acres of public land for sale in southern states\, with govern
 ment officials de facto excluding black people from the process so that wh
 ites could homestead it first.\n\nThe sale came via the passage of the Sou
 thern Homestead Act and made land available in Alabama\, Arkansas\, Florid
 a\, Louisiana\, and Mississippi. Until January 1st\, 1867\, the bill speci
 fied\, only free black people and loyal white people would be allowed acce
 ss to these lands. Homesteaders were required to occupy and improve the la
 nd for five years before acquiring full ownership.\n\nSouthern bureaucrats
  often obstructed or violated the law\, not informing black people of thei
 r right to land (thus delaying and allowing Confederates to be eligible\, 
 from 1867 onwards). It was also difficult for freed slaves to take advanta
 ge of the opportunity\, often lacking seed\, animals\, and farm tools.\n\n
 Despite this\, free black people entered about 6\,500 claims to homesteads
 \, 1\,000 of which eventually resulted in property certificates. The law w
 as repealed a decade later as part of a growing cooperation between Northe
 rn and Southern capitalists. This cooperation became more explicit with th
 e Compromise of 1877\, which resulted in the end of Reconstruction and fed
 eral troops withdrawing from Southern states.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1966\, the Japanese government announced the co
 nstruction of an airport on farmland in rural Sanrizuka\, without permissi
 on of displaced locals. The plans led to decades of resistance from locals
  in alliance with leftist groups.\n\nThe area around Sanrizuka had been fa
 rmland since the Middle Ages\, and\, prior to the 1940s\, much of the land
  had been privately owned by the Japanese Imperial Household.\n\nMany loca
 ls were economically reliant on the Imperial estate at Goryō Farm\, and l
 ocal farmers had a strong economic and emotional attachment to the land. A
 fter Japan's defeat in World War II\, large tracts of royal land were sold
  off and subsequently settled by poor rural laborers.\n\nIn the 1960s\, th
 e Japanese government planned to build a second airport in the Tokyo area 
 to support Japan's rapid economic development. After meeting resistance fr
 om locals on the site's first chosen location\, the rural town of Tomisato
 \, the government was donated remaining land in Sanrizuka by the Imperial 
 Family.\n\nLocals in Sanrizuka were outraged when the government announced
  its plans. The Sanrizuka-Shibayama United Opposition League Against the C
 onstruction of Narita Airport (or Hantai Dōmei) was formed in 1966\, and 
 began to engage in a variety of tactics of resistance\, including legal bu
 y-ups\, sit-ins\, and occupations.\n\nMeanwhile\, the Japanese radical stu
 dent movement was growing\, and the League soon formed an alliance with ac
 tive New Left groups\; one major factor drawing the groups the together wa
 s that\, under the US-Japan Security Treaty\, the US military had free acc
 ess to Japanese air facilities. As a result\, it was likely the airport wo
 uld be used for transporting troops and arms in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe de
 monstrators built huts and watchtowers along proposed construction sites. 
 On October 10th\, 1967\, the government attempted to conduct a land survey
 \, backed by over 2000 riot police. Clashes quickly broke out\, and Hantai
  Domei leader Issaku Tomura was photographed being brutalized by police\, 
 further inflaming anti-airport sentiment.\n\nProtests further grew and int
 ensified over the next few years as the state pressed on with attempts to 
 build the airport. Protestors would dig into the ground\, build fortificat
 ions\, and arm themselves against police. Construction was delayed by year
 s\, and the conflict would cost the government billions of yen. \n\nOn Sep
 tember 16th\, 1971\, three police officers were killed during an eminent d
 omain expropriation. Four days later\, police forcibly removed and destroy
 ed the house of an elderly woman\, an incident that became yet another sym
 bol of state oppression to the opposition. \n\nOne student committed suici
 de\, saying in his suicide note that "I detest those who brought the airpo
 rt to this land". In 1972\, the protestors built a 60 meter-high steel tow
 er near the runway in order to disrupt flight tests. Conflict continued th
 rough much of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1977\, the government announced plans to op
 en the airport within the year. In May\, police destroyed the tower while 
 demonstrators attempted to cling on to it\, provoking a new wave of widesp
 read conflict. One protestor was killed after being struck in the head by 
 a tear gas canister. In March 1978\, the first runway was set to open\, bu
 t a few days prior\, a group of saboteurs burrowed into the main control t
 ower\, barricaded themselves inside\, and proceeded to lay waste to the to
 wer's equipment and infrastructure\, delaying the opening yet again to May
  20th\, 1978.\n\nResistance continued after the airport was opened. Althou
 gh many locals began to accept the airport and leave the land\, the focus 
 of Hantai Dōmei shifted to opposing plans for additional terminals and ru
 nways\, as the airport's current size still only reflected a fraction of i
 nitial plans.\n\nClashes continued through the 1980s - on October 20th\, 1
 985\, members of the communist New Left group Chukaku-ha broke though poli
 ce lines with logs and flagpoles\, successfully attacking infrastructure i
 n one of the last large-scale battles of the resistance campaign. Guerilla
  actions and bombings continued as late as the 1990s.\n\nAlthough this cam
 paign of resistance has largely shifted out of public attention in Japan\,
  its presence is still felt: until 2015\, all visitors were required to pr
 esent ID cards for security reasons\, and the airport still remains only a
  third of its initially-planned size. The Sanrizuka Struggle has never com
 pletely ended\, and the Opposition League still exists and holds rallies.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1947\, the Taft-Hartley Act became U.S. law aft
 er a heavily bipartisan vote\, greatly restricting the legal rights of org

 .\n\nThe Labor Management Relations Act of 1947\, better known as the Taft
 -Hartley Act\, was enacted despite the veto of President Harry S. Truman\,
  with many Democrats defecting from the party line to support the union-bu
 sting measure.\n\nThe Act was introduced in the aftermath of a major\, unp
 recedented wave of strikes in the aftermath of World War II\, from 1945-19
 46. Strikes were strongly repressed during World War II to not hamper the 
 war effect. When the wartime restrictions ended\, millions of workers acro
 ss the country went on strike.\n\nThe Taft-Hartley Act prohibits unions fr
 om engaging in "unfair labor practices." Among the practices prohibited by
  the act are jurisdictional strikes\, wildcat strikes\, solidarity or poli
 tical strikes\, secondary boycotts\, secondary and mass picketing\, closed
  shops\, and monetary donations by unions to federal political campaigns. 
 The Act also allowed states to pass right-to-work laws banning union shops
 .\n\nA pamphlet supporting a third\, progressive party\, published in 1948
 \, had this to say on the vote:\n\n"Every scheme of the lobbyists to fleec
 e the public became law in the 80th Congress. And every constructive propo
 sal to benefit the common people gathered dust in committee pigeonholes. T
 he bi-partisan bloc\, the Republocratic cabal which ruled Congress and mad
 e a mockery of President Roosevelt's economic bill of rights\, also wrecke
 d the Roosevelt foreign policy. A new foreign policy was developed. This p
 olicy was still gilded with the good words of democracy. But its Holy Grai
 l was oil...\n\nThe Democratic administration carries the ball for Wall St
 reet's foreign policy. And the Republican party carries the ball for Wall 
 Street's domestic policy. Of course the roles are sometimes interchangeabl
 e...\n\nOn occasion President Truman still likes to lay an occasional verb
 al wreath on the grave of the New Deal. But the hard facts of roll call vo
 tes show that Democrats are voting more and more like Republicans. If the 
 Republican Taft-Hartley bill became law over the President's veto\, it was
  because many of the Democrats allied themselves to the Republicans."

DESCRIPTION:The Radom Riots began in Poland on this day in 1976 when tens 
 of thousands of people began protesting and rioting in response to governm
 ent increases in the price of food\, chanting "We want bread and freedom" 
 and fighting with police. This uprising took place in the context of socia
 l unrest throughout the country.\n\nThat morning\, workers at multiple fac
 tories across Radom went on strike. By 11 am\, thousands of protesters sur
 rounded an administrative building in the city.\n\nAfter waiting for an of
 ficial decision on the issue of food increases for several hours\, the cro
 wd broke into the building\, which had been evacuated\, looting and settin
 g it on fire and barricading the surrounding streets.\n\nBecause the state
  did not plan on Radom having an uprising of this size\, police forces wer
 e initially overwhelmed and reinforcements did not arrive until later that
  afternoon.\n\nApproximately 20\,000 people battled with police forces. 19
 8 people were wounded\, 634 arrested\, and several were killed. A few week
 s after the uprising\, a Roman Catholic priest died after being beaten by 
 police\, having joined the rioters and criticized the government in his se
 rmons.\n\nDespite the government crackdown\, the price raises were reverse
 d within 24 hours. The 1976 workers' protest against official economic pol
 icy was a watershed moment in dissent against the Polish People's Republic
 .

DESCRIPTION:George Orwell\, born on this day in 1903\, was an English demo
 cratic socialist author. His experiences in the Spanish Civil War led him 
 to rabidly oppose Soviet communism\, views expounded upon in Animal Farm a
 nd Homage to Catalonia.\n\nOrwell's work is characterized by polished pros
 e\, social criticism\, opposition to what Orwell called "totalitarianism"\
 , and support for democratic socialism.\n\nAs a writer\, Orwell produced l
 iterary criticism\, poetry\, fiction\, and polemical journalism. Among his
  most famous works are his allegory for the Soviet Union "Animal Farm" (19
 45) and the dystopian novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four" (1949). Orwell is also 
 noted for his first hand-account of the Spanish Civil War\, "Homage to Cat
 alonia" (1938).\n\nIn "Homage to Catalonia"\, Orwell writes about fighting
  for the Republican faction\, describing in detail the ways in which the a
 narchist movement re-structured their economy and military to be more egal
 itarian. He was shot in the throat but survived\, declared unfit for servi
 ce\, and returned to England to recover.\n\nOrwell's experiences with anar
 chist and Bolshevik movements in Catalonia made him a vehement anti-commun
 ist later in life. In 1949\, shortly before he died\, Orwell prepared a li
 st of notable people he considered unsuitable as possible writers for the 
 anti-communist propaganda activities of the British government.\n\nThe act
 ion drew widespread criticism from other left-wing figures\; Scottish jour
 nalist Alexander Cockburn referred to the notebook as "a snitch list" and 
 noted Orwell's homophobia and racist comments on various individuals on th
 e list as demonstrative of his bigotry.\n\nDespite his vehement opposition
  to the Soviet Union and associated communist movements\, Orwell continued
  to identify as a democratic socialist and authored essays such as "The Li
 on and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius" (1940) that advocate
 d for socialism\, as Orwell understood it\, in the United Kingdom.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1950\, the northern Korean People's Army crosse
 d the 38th parallel in an offensive to crush the Republic of Korea\, an im
 perialist puppet state established by the U.S.\, marking the beginning of 
 the Korean War.\n\nAlthough June 25th\, 1950 is where the beginning of the
  Korean War is traditionally marked\, other interpretations of the conflic
 t exist.\n\nHistorian Stephen Gowans\, author of "Patriots\, Traitors and 
 Empires: The Story of Korea's Struggle for Freedom"\, notes that some anal
 ysts\, including a member of the U.S. State Department\, consider the Kore
 an War to have begun with the creation of the U.S.-imposed Republic of Kor
 ea on August 15th\, 1948\, and some consider the conflict of 1950-53 an ex
 tension of a civil war that began in 1932\, when Kim Il-sung formed his fi
 rst guerrilla unit to fight Japanese colonizers.\n\nIn any case\, the Kore
 an War of 1950-53 was fought between two states that both lay claim to all
  of the Korean Peninsula\, the northern Democratic People's Republic of Ko
 rea (DPRK) and the southern Republic of Korea (ROK).\n\nThe ROK had been e
 stablished by the occupying U.S. military government in 1948. In 1945\, th
 e same military government had banned the left-leaning People's Republic o
 f Korea\, which was based on a network of worker's committees whose progra
 m consisted of pro-labor reforms\, such as the abolition of child labor an
 d the eight hour day.\n\nOn June 25th\, 1950\, the DPRK People's Army cros
 sed the 38th Parallel into ROK territory\, intending to crush the state of
  U.S.-collaborationists. Two days later\, the United Nations Security Coun
 cil\, then boycotted by the Soviet Union for not acknowledging the People'
 s Republic of China (PRC)\, recommended member states provide military ass
 istance to the Republic of Korea.\n\nThe conflict became a proxy war betwe
 en global superpowers\, with the DPRK supported by the Soviet Union and PR
 C and the ROK supported by the U.S. On July 27th\, 1953 the Korean Armisti
 ce Agreement was signed\, creating the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to 
 separate North and South Korea. Despite this\, no peace treaty was ever si
 gned and the two governments remain at war to this day.\n\nThe Korean War 
 was among the most destructive conflicts of the modern era\, with approxim
 ately 3 million war fatalities\, 10% of the total Korean population\, a la
 rger proportional civilian death toll than both World War II and the Vietn
 am War according to historian Charles Armstrong.\n\nThe U.S. led a massive
 \, scorched earth bombing campaign against North Korea\, making North Kore
 a one of the most heavily bombed countries in human history. Armstrong wri
 tes "U.S. planes dropped 635\,000 tons of bombs on Korea - that is\, essen
 tially on North Korea - including 32\,557 tons of napalm\, compared to 503
 \,000 tons of bombs dropped in the entire Pacific theatre of World War II.
  It incurred the destruction of virtually all of Korea's major cities."\n\
 nThis campaign of destruction was essential to the success of U.S. interve
 ntion: American General Matthew Ridgway stated that\, except for air power
 \, "the war would have been over in 60 days with all Korea in Communist ha
 nds".

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1954\, Jacobo Árbenz\, the democratically elec
 ted President of Guatemala who had been redistributing land owned by U.S. 
 capitalists\, was forced to resign in a coup led by the CIA and supported 
 by the United Fruit Company.\n\nÁrbenz was a major figure in the ten-year
  Guatemalan Revolution\, which represented some of the few years of repres
 entative democracy in Guatemalan history. His agrarian reform\, which uncu
 ltivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for c
 ompensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers be
 nefited approximately 500\,000 people\, most of them indigenous\, whose an
 cestors had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion.\n\nThis land ref
 orm alienated the powerful United Fruit Company\, the largest land owner i
 n Guatemala at the time\, which lobbied the U.S. government to have him ov
 erthrown. The U.S.\, also concerned by the presence of communists in the G
 uatemalan government\, began planning a coup\, to be led by the Central In
 telligence Agency (CIA).\n\nThe CIA armed\, funded\, and trained a force o
 f 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guat
 emala on June 18th and was backed by a heavy campaign of psychological war
 fare\, which included a radio station which broadcast anti-government prop
 aganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion\, claim
 ing to be genuine news.\n\nAlthough the invasion force's military actions 
 fared poorly\, the psychological warfare and fear of a U.S. invasion intim
 idated the Guatemalan army\, which eventually refused to fight. Árbenz br
 iefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion
 \, before resigning on this day in 1954. He was succeeded in power by Carl
 os Castillo Armas\, the same man who led the invading force.

 activities to social service and the blind\, they compliment me extravagan

 exuals and drag queens\, the crowd fought them\, trapping police inside an
 d lighting the Inn on fire.\n\nIn the 1960s\, New York City Robert Wagner 
 Jr. initiated an anti-gay campaign in preparation for the 1964 World's Fai
 r. The city revoked the liquor licenses of gay bars and undercover police 
 officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.\n\nThe Stone
 wall Inn is a prominent gay bar in Greenwich Village\, New York City\, the
 n owned by the Genovese crime family and lacking a liquor license. The nig
 ht of the Stonewall Uprising\, approximately 200 patrons were in the bar\,
  and four undercover cops were present before the raid was initiated.\n\nA
 s cops shut the bar down and began arresting patrons\, a crowd began to ga
 ther outside. A scuffle broke out when a butch woman in handcuffs (thought
  by many to be Stormé DeLarverie but accounts differ) fought with police 
 for ten minutes as they attempted to arrest her.\n\nAfter she shouted to b
 ystanders "Why don't you guys do something?"\, an officer picked her up an
 d heaved her into the back of the wagon and the crowd turned violent\, att
 empting to overturn police cars and slashing their tires\, and throwing de
 bris at the cops\, some of whom became trapped in the Inn.\n\nSome members
  of the mob lit garbage on fire and stuffed it through the broken windows\
 , setting the bar on fire with police and some detainees inside. A tactica
 l police force was deployed to free the officers\, beating the crowd as th
 ey mocked police with impromptu kick lines and ironic chants.\n\nWhen the 
 violence broke out\, women and transmasculine people being held down the s
 treet at The Women's House of Detention joined in by chanting\, setting fi
 re to their belongings\, tossing them into the street below\, and chanting
  "gay rights".\n\nThe uprisings continued for several nights afterward\, w
 ith thousands showing up outside the bar. Black drag queen and radical que
 er rights activist Marsha P. Johnson was seen climbing a lamppost and drop
 ping a heavy bag onto the hood of a police car\, shattering the windshield
 .\n\nMembers of the Mattachine Society\, a gay rights organization which h
 ad taken to respectability politics\, were embarrassed by the behavior at 
 Stonewall. Randy Wicker\, who had marched in the first gay picket lines be
 fore the White House in 1965\, said "screaming queens forming chorus lines
  and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about h
 omosexuals...that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting dis
 orderly and tacky and cheap." Others were glad to see the closing of Stone
 wall Inn\, perceived as a "sleaze joint".\n\nDespite this backlash\, some 
 participants of the annual Mattachine Society picket on July 4th were embo
 ldened. Several same-sex couples held hands as they marched despite protes
 ts from lead organizers of the picket\, generating more press attention fo
 r the event than usual.\n\nThe Stonewall Uprising was a watershed moment i
 n the history of queer liberation\, to the extent that some studies of LGB

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1960\, the Republic of the Congo became indepen
 dent from Belgian colonizers\, beginning a four year period of civil war w
 hich killed approximately 100\,000 people\, including the country's first 
 Prime Minister\, Patrice Lumumba. The complex period of political strife i
 s known as the "Congo Crisis".\n\nThe Congo had been colonized by Belgium 
 since the late 19th century\, a process initiated by King Leopold II of Be
 lgium\, who was frustrated by Belgium's lack of international power and pr
 estige.\n\nA nationalist movement within the Belgian Congo began to gain m
 omentum in the 1950s\, consisting of rival factions such as the Mouvement 
 National Congolais (MNC)\, of which Patrice Lumumba (shown) was a leading 
 figure\, and Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO)\, led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu.\n\nFo
 llowing major riots in Stanleyville and Léopoldville in 1959\, a Round Ta
 ble Conference in Brussels was held in January 1960\, with leaders from al
 l the major Congolese parties in attendance.\n\nCongolese leaders were suc
 cessful in negotiating their independence to be granted within months\, fo
 rmally winning their independence from Belgium in late June. Within days\,
  violence between white and black communities broke out\, and the country 
 descended into a civil war between rival political factions. Some factions
 \, supported by powerful mining interests\, began seceding from the newly 
 founded Republic of Congo.\n\nThe United Nations sent in peacekeeping troo
 ps\, which were initially welcomed by Lumumba and the central government w
 ith the idea that the UN would help suppress the secessionist states. View
 ing the secessions as an internal political matter\, the UN refused to use
  its troops to assist the central Congolese government against them.\n\nLu
 mumba also sought the assistance of the U.S. government\, led by Dwight D.
  Eisenhower\, who refused to provide meaningful military aid. He then turn
 ed to the Soviet Union\, which agreed to provide weapons\, logistical and 
 material support\, which the state promptly used against the secessionists
 .\n\nDespite Lumumba's public proclamations that he was not a communist\, 
 the United States viewed the acceptance of aid with alarm\, and Lumumba be
 came a target of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) surveillance. Lumumba w
 as captured and\, on January 17th\, 1961\, executed by Belgian-assisted fo
 rces.\n\nThe factional conflict continued in the wake of Lumumba's death\,
  with fighting and intervention coming from Western states\, the United Na
 tions\, and various political groups inside the Congo.\n\nIn 1964\, a grou
 p known as the Simbas initiated a rebellion based on egalitarian ideals an
 d witchcraft. In November 1964\, the Simbas rounded up the remaining white
  population of Stanleyville\, holding them hostage in the Victoria Hotel t
 o use as bargaining tools with the Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC).\n\nT
 o recover the hostages\, Belgian parachute troops were flown to the Congo 
 in American aircraft. More than 70 hostages and 1\,000 Congolese civilians
  were killed in the rescue mission\, but the vast majority of hostages wer
 e evacuated.\n\nFollowing chaotic elections in 1964\, Joseph-Désiré Mobu
 tu took power in a military coup\, assuming sweeping powers and institutin
 g widespread political repression. Mobutu\, who had played a key role in L
 umumba's execution\, ruled until 1997\, enjoying support from the United S
 tates\, France\, Belgium\, and China.

DESCRIPTION:Operation PBHistory was a covert CIA operation that began on t
 his day in 1954\, following their ousting of Guatemalan President Jacobo 
 Árbenz\, seeking to damage his reputation\, disseminate propaganda\, and 
 spy on Latin American communists.\n\nPBHistory followed Operation PBSucces
 s\, which led to the overthrow of Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz in J
 une 1954 and ended the Guatemalan Revolution\, a decade long period of soc
 ial reforms and representative democracy.\n\nPBHistory seized documents (m
 ore than 500\,000 in total) left behind by Árbenz's government and organi
 zations related to the communist Guatemalan Party of Labor\, attempting to
  use them to promote propaganda that Guatemala was under the control of th
 e Soviet Union and obtain intelligence that would be useful in undermining
  left-wing movements in Latin America. One consequence of this intelligenc
 e was the CIA beginning to track Che Guevara\, who was then only known to 
 the Agency as a physician.\n\nOperation PBHistory also helped set up the G
 uatemalan National Committee of Defense Against Communism\, which was cove
 rtly funded by the CIA and responsible for mass repression of the populati
 on.\n\nDespite successfully obtaining intelligence and collaborating with 
 the new government of Castillo Armas (a vehement anti-communist on the CIA
  payroll who led the coup against Árbenz)\, the psy-op was not successful
  in undermining Árbenz's reputation or fostering pro-U.S. sentiment throu
 ghout Latin America.

DESCRIPTION:Clara Zetkin\, born on this day in 1857\, was a German Marxist
  theorist\, activist\, and feminist\, active in the revolutionary Spartaci
 st League and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).\n\nClara Zetkin was bo
 rn in Wiederau\, a peasant village in Saxony\, now part of the municipalit
 y Königshain-Wiederau. Because of the ban placed on socialist activity in
  Germany by Bismarck in 1878\, Zetkin left for Zurich in 1882 then went in
 to exile in Paris\, where she studied to be a journalist and a translator.
 \n\nZetkin was very interested in women's politics\, including the fight f
 or equal opportunities and women's suffrage\, though always through a soci
 alist paradigm. She helped to develop the social-democratic women's moveme
 nt in Germany\; from 1891 to 1917 she edited the Social Democratic Party (
 SPD) women's newspaper Die Gleichheit (Equality). She also contributed to 
 International Women's Day (IWD).\n\nAround 1898\, Zetkin formed a friendsh
 ip with the younger Rosa Luxemburg that lasted 20 years. Despite Luxemburg
 's indifference to the women's movement\, they became staunch political al
 lies on the far left of the SPD. Luxemburg once suggested that their joint
  epitaph would be "Here lie the last two men of German Social Democracy."\
 n\nIn August 1932\, despite having recently fallen gravely ill in Moscow\,
  she returned to Berlin to preside over the opening of the newly elected R
 eichstag. There\, she gave a speech urging Germany to reject fascism\, sta
 ting "all those who feel themselves threatened\, all those who suffer and 
 all those who long for liberation must belong to the United Front against 
 fascism and its representatives in government".\n\nWhen Hitler seized powe
 r the following year\, Zetkin once again fled Germany\, dying in Moscow in
  1933 at the age of 76.\n\n"The working women\, who aspire to social equal
 ity\, expect nothing for their emancipation from the bourgeois women's mov
 ement\, which allegedly fights for the rights of women. That edifice is bu
 ilt on sand and has no real basis. Working women are absolutely convinced 
 that the question of the emancipation of women is not an isolated question
  which exists in itself\, but part of the great social question."\n\n- Cla

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1912\, a riot broke out in Grabow\, Louisiana w
 hen gunfire was exchanged between organizing lumber workers and private gu
 nmen hired by the Galloway Lumber Company\, just one event in the Louisian
 a-Texas Lumber War. The clash left three union workers and one company gun
 man dead\, wounding an estimated fifty more.\n\nThe event took place in th
 e context of workers in the sawmill town of Grabow joining the Brotherhood
  of Timber Workers (shown)\, a branch of the Lumber Workers Industrial Uni
 on (LWIU)\, itself affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World (IW
 W).\n\nOn July 7th\, 1912\, the union workers held a series of rallies at 
 several different company towns\, including Bon Ami and Carson\, alongside
  Grabow.\n\nThe group that went to Grabow\, around 200 people\, spontaneou
 sly decided to hold a rally with several speeches - labor leader Arthur L.
  Emerson spoke on top of a wagon to roughly 25 non-union men\, plus the ad
 ditional union men who had come with him.\n\nShots began between these wor
 kers and a group of four others\, including Galloway Lumber owner John Gal
 loway\, in the local mill office\, all of whom had later been found to be 
 drinking before the incident. It is not known for certain which group fire
 d first. Three union men were killed alongside one member of the private c
 ompany security force. Approximately 50 more were wounded.\n\nOver the nex
 t few days\, more than more than 60 workers were taken into custody by pol
 ice. Although the mill owner himself was arrested\, he was released withou
 t charges soon afterward. Sixty-five of the timber workers' group were bro
 ught up on charges ranging from inciting a riot to murder.\n\nThe IWW work
 ed to aid the incarcerated workers\, with "Big Bill" Haywood fundraising f
 or their legal fund. The trial lasted until November 8th\, and its jury re
 turned a not guilty verdict for all of the union men. All of those arreste
 d were set free.\n\nAlthough they had limited success in Louisiana\, the L
 WIU successfully organized later\, winning an eight-hour day and vastly im
 proved working conditions in the Pacific Northwest after a 1917 strike. To
 day\, there is a historical marker at the site of the riot\, located on wh

  successfully won that publicity\, bringing national attention to the plig

  1948 Arab–Israeli War spilled over into the city of Acre\, Kanafani and
  his family were forced into exile while he was still a child. After fleei

  the PFLP's weekly magazine\, al-Hadaf ("The Goal"). He drafted a PFLP pro

  departure from pan-Arab nationalist ideology.\n\nOn July 8th\, 1972\, at 
 the age of 36\, Kanafani was assassinated via car bomb by the Israeli inte

 lity for the Lod Airport Massacre.\n\nThe massacre\, committed by three me
 mbers of the Japanese Red Army recruited by the PLFP\, killed 26 people\, 
 injuring 80 others.\n\nGhassan Kanafani was an influential author\, whose 
 literary works have been translated into at least 17 languages and publish
 ed in 20 countries. He began writing short stories when working as a teach
 er in refugee camps. Often written through the eyes of children\, his stor
 ies were designed to help his students contextualize their surroundings.\n

 , which was en route to protest a nuclear weapons test planned by the Fren
 ch state. The bombing\, later found to be personally ordered by French Pre

 ting campaigns during the late 1970s and early 1980s\, including relocatin
 g 300 Marshall Islanders from Rongelap Atoll\, which had been polluted by 
 radioactive fallout by past American nuclear tests.\n\nFor the 1985 tests\
 , Greenpeace intended to monitor the impact of nuclear tests and place pro
 testers on the island to observe the blasts. Three undercover French agent
 s were on board\, however\, and they attached two limpet mines to Rainbow 
 Warrior and detonated them ten minutes apart\, sinking the ship.\n\nFrance
  initially denied responsibility\, but two of the French agents were captu
 red by New Zealand Police and charged with arson\, conspiracy to commit ar
 son\, willful damage\, and murder.\n\nThe resulting scandal led to the res
 ignation of the French Defence Minister Charles Hernu\, while the two agen
 ts pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to ten years in priso
 n. They spent a little over two years confined to the French island of Hao
  before being freed by the French government.\n\nIn 1987\, after internati

  finance another ship. It also paid compensation to the Pereira family\, m
 aking reparation payments of 650\,000 francs to Pereira's wife\, 1.5 milli

 placed explosives beneath an ore mill and gave its manager the choice betw

 ormer. Before the day was over\, six people were killed and dozens were wo
 unded.\n\nFollowing this violence\, martial law was declared in Coeur d'Al

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1917\, a deputized posse in Bisbee\, Arizona ki
 dnapped more than 1\,300 striking miners\, their supporters\, and bystande
 rs\, deporting them to New Mexico\, more than 200 miles away. The miners w
 ere organized by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)\, and had been 
 on strike since June 26th.\n\nThe action was orchestrated by Phelps Dodge\
 , the major mining company in the area\, which provided lists of workers a
 nd others who were to be arrested to the Cochise County sheriff\, Harry C.
  Wheeler.\n\nThe 16-hour journey was through desert without food and with 
 little water. Once unloaded\, the deportees\, most without money or transp
 ortation\, were warned against returning to Bisbee. The U.S. government so
 on brought in members of the US Army to assist with relocating the deporte
 es to Columbus\, New Mexico.\n\nPhelps Dodge\, in collusion with the sheri
 ff\, had closed down access to outside communications\, so the story was n
 ot well reported at the time.\n\nAlthough a federal commission concluded t
 he kidnapping was done "wholly illegal and without authority in law\, eith
 er State or Federal" and the U.S. Department of Justice ordered the arrest
  of 21 Phelps Dodge executives\, no individual\, company\, or agency was e
 ver convicted in connection with the deportations.

 e regions of Valencia\, Murcia and Andalusia. In these areas\, cantons wer
 e formed\, whose federation would constitute the base of the Spanish Feder
 al Republic. Although the federalists defied the authority of the Cortes\,
  some historians do not consider the movement separatist in character.\n\n
 The Cantonal Rebellion was put down by force from the First Spanish Republ
 ic\, which justified its actions as maintaining the rule of law. When the 
 last canton\, Cartagena\, surrendered\, thousands of people were deported 
 to the Philippines\, Cuba\, and the Marianas Islands on charges of being a
  federalist.

DESCRIPTION:Buenaventura Durruti\, born on this day in 1896\, was a promin
 ent anarchist revolutionary who organized socialist resistance in Spain\, 
 participating in general strikes and leading the Durruti Column during the
  Spanish Civil War.\n\nAt age fourteen\, Durruti left school to become a t
 rainee mechanic in the railway yard in León. Like his father\, he joined 
 the socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT).\n\nHe later took an ac
 tive part in a 1917 strike that was brutally repressed by the Spanish Army
 . Seventy people were killed\, five hundred were injured\, and at least 2\
 ,000 of the strikers were imprisoned without trial or legal process. Altho
 ugh Durruti managed to escape to France\, the violence of state repression
  left a strong impression on a young Durruti.\n\nWith Juan García Oliver\
 , Francisco Ascaso\, Miguel Garcia Vivancos\, Alfonso Miguel\, Ricardo San
 z\, and Aurelio Hernandez\, he founded Los Solidarios ("The Solidarity")\,
  a notable "grupo de afinidad" implicated in the assassination of Cardinal
  Juan Soldevilla y Romero.\n\nWorking with the CNT-FAI\, Durruti helped co
 ordinate armed resistance to the military rising of the Nationalist factio
 n during the Spanish Civil War\, an effort which was to prove vital in pre
 venting General Goded's attempt to seize control of Barcelona. On July 24t
 h\, 1936 Durruti led over 3\,000 armed anarchists (later known as the Durr
 uti Column) from Barcelona to Zaragoza.\n\nHe was mortally shot under disp
 uted circumstances on November 19th\, dying the next day. A few hours afte
 r Durruti's death\, CNT-FAI troops massacred 52 policemen\, who had been h
 eld captive in a monastery in Calle de Santa Engracia\, in reprisal.\n\n"I
 t is we who built these palaces and cities\, here in Spain and in America 
 and everywhere. We\, the workers. We can build others to take their place.
  And better ones! We are not in the least afraid of ruins. We are going to
  inherit the earth. There is not the slightest doubt about that. The bourg

 age cut was revoked. West Virginia Governor Henry M. Mathews sent in Natio
 nal Guard units to restore train service. When the soldiers refused to fir
 e on the workers\, he appealed for federal troops.\n\nBecause of economic 
 problems and pressure on wages by the railroads\, workers in numerous othe

 people were killed across the country and more than one hundred million do

 railroad's buildings\, engines\, and railroad cars.\n\nDue to this unrest

 King Louis XVI. The Bastille was an armory and prison\, perceived by many 
 as a symbol of royal authority in the city.\n\nOn the morning of July 14th
 \, a crowd of approximately one thousand people surrounded the Bastille\, 
 calling for the surrender of the prison\, the removal of its cannon\, and 
 the release of the arms and gunpowder stored there.\n\nAfter negotiations 
 stalled\, the crowd surged into the courtyard of the Bastille and were fir

 ight protesters and one defender of the Bastille were killed.\n\nGovernor 
 Marquis de Launay\, fearing his troops could not hold out\, capitulated to
  the crowd and opened up the Bastille doors. He was captured and dragged t
 owards the Hôtel de Ville in a storm of abuse. While the crowd debated hi
 s fate\, the badly beaten Launay shouted "Enough! Let me die!"\, kicked a 
 pastry cook in the groin\, and was then promptly stabbed to death.\n\nAs n
 ews of the successful seizure of the Bastille spread throughout the countr

 t and militias for civic protection\, burned deeds of property\, and in so
 me cases attacked wealthy landlords.\n\nKing Louis XVI first learned of th
 e storming the next morning through the Duke of La Rochefoucauld. "Is it a
  revolt?" asked the King. The duke replied: "No sire\, it's not a revolt\;
  it's a revolution."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1964\, a New York City cop shot and killed a fi
 fteen year old boy\, James Powell\, leading to riots across Harlem in whic
 h residents protested\, clashed with police\, and caused approximately $1 
 million in property damage.\n\nThe rebellion began after Police Lieutenant
  Thomas Gilligan shot Powell three times in front of his friends and about
  a dozen other witnesses. Powell had entered the home of Patrick Lynch\, a
  superintendent of three apartment houses in Yorkville\, to confront him a
 fter he hosed down black students for allegedly hanging out on his buildin
 g's stoops.\n\nGilligan\, then off-duty\, shot Powell while he was leaving
  Lynch's building. Although Gilligan claims Powell lunged at him with a kn
 ife\, witnesses did not corroborate this account\; some stated he raised h
 is right hand in a defensive gesture before being killed.\n\nImmediately a
 fter Powell's killing\, a group of student protesters clashed with police 
 securing the crime scene. The second day\, the Congress of Racial Equality
  (CORE) joined the protests.\n\nOn July 18th\, the protests became an outr
 ight rebellion after Powell's funeral\, monitored closely by barricaded po
 lice. After the funeral ended and most of the press left\, the crowd and c
 ops began to fight. Residents took to the rooftops\, throwing bricks\, bot
 tles\, and mortar at the police below. When one officer shouted "Go home\,
  go home!" at the crowd\, a reply was heard: "We are home\, Baby."\n\nThe 
 unrest lasted until July 22nd\, and included a mix of moderate factions fr
 om the NAACP as well as black nationalists. When prominent civil rights ac
 tivist Bayard Rustin tried to discourage rioting\, the crowd booed and cha
 nted "Tom\, Uncle Tom". When an NAACP representative addressed the crowd\,
  stating Bedford-Stuyvesant was a "community of law" and discouraging riot
 ing\, his van was rocked until he lost control of his microphone.\n\nAt th
 e end of the conflict\, reports counted one dead rioter\, 118 injured\, an
 d 465 arrested. In September\, Gilligan was cleared of any wrongdoing by a
  grand jury and charges were dropped.

 list and civil rights activist. "If labor is withdrawn capital will not re
 main...The white man's dollar is his god\, and to stop this will be to sto
 p outrages in many localities."\n\nBorn into slavery on July 16th\, 1862\,
  Wells was freed by the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. After moving to
  Memphis\, Tennessee\, Wells began working as a teacher and wrote for the 
 Memphis Free Speech and Headlight newspaper\, which she also co-owned. Her
  reporting covered incidents of racial injustice.\n\nIn the 1890s\, Wells 
 documented lynching in her works "Horrors" and "The Red Record". Her docum
 entation undermined the white supremacist claim that lynching was somethin
 g only done to criminals\, and her analysis exposed lynching as a means of
  killing and intimidating black people whose competition was threatening w
 hite power.\n\nWells' work was carried nationally in black-owned newspaper
 s\, gaining prominence and earning the ire of white supremacists. On May 2
 1st\, 1892\, Wells published an editorial in the Free Speech refuting what
  she called "that old threadbare lie that Negro men rape White women. If S
 outhern men are not careful\, a conclusion might be reached which will be 
 very damaging to the moral reputation of their women."\n\nFollowing this s
 tatement\, Wells was denounced as a "Black scoundrel" in the press and an 
 angry white mob burned down the Free Speech offices while she was out of t
 own. A group of local white businessmen located Rev. Nightingale\, the fou
 nder of the Free Speech\, assaulted him and forced him at gunpoint to sign
  a letter retracting Wells' editorial. Wells never returned to Memphis.\n\
 nWells was also active in the women's suffrage movement\, however her unre
 lenting advocacy for racial justice clashed with contemporary\, predominan
 tly white suffrage organizations.\n\nIn 1893\, Wells and Frances Willard\,
  President of the white Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU)\, were t
 raveling separately to Britain on lecture tours. Wells publicly criticized
  Willard for remaining silent on the issue of lynching and blaming black p
 eople for a lack of success with her reform campaign in the American South
 .\n\nIn 1909\, Wells co-founded The National Association for the Advanceme
 nt of Colored People (NAACP) along with figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois and
  Mary White Ovington.\n\nIn the late 1920s\, Wells began writing her autob
 iography but didn't finish the book before dying of kidney failure in 1931
  at age 68. The text was posthumously edited and published by her daughter
  Alfreda Barnett Duster as "Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida 
 B. Wells."\n\n"If labor is withdrawn capital will not remain. The Afro-Ame
 rican is thus the backbone of the South. The white man's dollar is his god
 \, and to stop this will be to stop outrages in many localities."\n\n- Ida

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1946\, Maceo Snipes\, the first black person to
  vote in Georgia's Taylor County\, was shot by white supremacists\, dying 
 after doctors refused to give him a blood transfusion due to segregation. 
 The violence outraged a teenage MLK Jr.\n\nSnipes was a World War II veter
 an who had returned to his hometown of Butler\, Georgia. In 1946\, a provo
 cative campaign issue was whether or not black people should be allowed to
  vote in primary elections. Georgia's Jim Crow government had been enforci
 ng whites-only primary elections\, but this had been struck down by the Su
 preme Court earlier that year.\n\nDespite threats from the Ku Klux Klan\, 
 Snipes cast his vote in the primary election on July 17th that year\, beco
 ming the first black person to vote in Taylor County\, according to the Ge
 orgia Civil Rights Cold Cases Project. The following day\, four white supr
 emacists showed up to Maceo's house\, interrupting dinner with his wife\, 
 and shot him in the back. The man who shot him\, Edward Williamson\, was a
 lso a World War II veteran.\n\nSnipes was taken to the hospital\, where he
  waited for several hours before the doctors would perform the surgery to 
 remove the bullets. A white doctor told his family that Maceo needed a tra
 nsfusion\, but refused to give him one\, citing a lack of "black blood" in
  the hospital. Without a transfusion\, Snipes died two days later. Snipes'
  funeral was held in the middle of the night due to death threats for anyo
 ne who dared attend. \n\nIn court\, Maceo's killers falsely pleaded self-d
 efense\, claiming that Snipes owed them money and attacked them with a kni
 fe. Both the coroner and jury determined their actions to be justified. Sn
 ipes was one of five black people lynched following the 1946 elections - t

COMMENT:Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela\, born on this day in 1918\, was a South
  African anti-apartheid revolutionary who served as President the African 
 National Congress (ANC) from 1991 to 1997 and of South Africa itself from 
 1994 to 1999.
DESCRIPTION:Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela\, born on this day in 1918\, was a S
 outh African anti-apartheid revolutionary who served as President the Afri
 can National Congress (ANC) from 1991 to 1997 and of South Africa itself f
 rom 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the f
 irst elected in an election in which South Africans of all races could par
 ticipate.\n\nWhile working as a clerk for a law firm as a young man\, Mand
 ela befriended two communists - Gaur Radebe\, a Hlubi member of the ANC an
 d Communist Party\, and Nat Bregman\, a Jewish communist who became his fi
 rst white friend. Mandela attended Communist Party meetings and\, while im
 pressed that people of all races were able to meet as equals\, he did not 
 join the party because its atheism conflicted with his own Christianity\, 
 and because he saw the South African struggle as being based in race rathe
 r than class.\n\nMandela joined the ANC a few years later\, quickly rising
  through its ranks. Although initially committed to non-violent protest\, 
 he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage ca
 mpaign against the apartheid government.\n\nOn August 5th\, 1962\, Mandela
  was captured by South African police\, informed by the American Central I
 ntelligence Agency (CIA) of his location. In the subsequent legal proceedi
 ngs\, known as the "Rivonia Trial"\, he was sentenced to life in prison.\n
 \nAmid growing domestic and international pressure\, and with fears of a r
 acial civil war\, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990 and began 
 negotiating a peaceable end to apartheid with him. In 1994\, he became the
  first legitimately elected President of South Africa.\n\nMandela saw nati
 onal reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency\, and hoped to a
 void the damage other post-colonial African economies faced by the departu
 re of white elites.\n\nMandela worked to reassure South Africa's white pop
 ulation that they were protected and represented in the so-called "the Rai
 nbow Nation" and embraced liberal reforms\, drawing criticism from more hi
 s more radical supporters.\n\n"Resentment is like drinking poison and then
  hoping it will kill your enemies."\n\n- Nelson Mandela

  He was assassinated on this day in 1947 by a right-wing nationalist refug

 the son of a local yangban magnate. In 1910\, Lyuh parted from Korean trad

 n 1920\, he joined the Koryǒ Communist Party\, later meeting Leon Trotsky
  and Vladimir Lenin. In 1924\, he also joined Sun Yat-sen's Chinese Nation
 alist Party to facilitate Sino-Korean cooperation.\n\nIn September 1945\, 
 Lyuh proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Korea and be
 came its vice-premier. When the United States occupied the Korean Peninsul
 a\, it did not recognize the People's Republic of Korea\, and in October h
 e was forced to step down under pressure from the U.S. military government
 .\n\nIn 1946\, Lyuh represented the center-left politically as part of an 
 effort to unify right and left-wing independence struggles\, however this 
 strategy earned ire from both sides. On July 19th\, 1947\, Lyuh was assass

 mber of a nationalist right-wing organization.\n\nHis pen-name was Mongyan

 , joining two trains' worth of cars into one train with two engines\, for 
 all trains moving through Pittsburgh\, a policy that would reduce the numb

  to cede control of the trains to the company\, and by midnight up to 1\,4

 g the movement of some 1\,500 cars.\n\nBy the morning of the 21st\, it had
  become clear that many of the Pittsburgh police and local militia had sid

  Pennsylvania National Guard were sent in to forcibly quell the rebellion\
 , and the protest turned into a riot after troops shot into a crowd of peo

 setting fire to the train cars and the Union Depot (shown). They also exch
 anged fire with the National Guard soldiers.\n\nIn total\, an estimated 53
  civilians were killed and 109 were injured. Eight soldiers were killed in
  the clashes\, another fifteen wounded. This was one of many incidents of 
 strikes\, labor unrest and violence in cities across the United States as 
 part of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.

DESCRIPTION:Frantz Fanon\, born on this day in 1925\, was a West Indian Pa
 n-Africanist philosopher and Algerian revolutionary most known for his tex
 t The Wretched of the Earth.\n\nFanon was born to an affluent family on th
 e Caribbean island of Martinique\, then a French colony which is still und
 er French control today. As a teenager\, he was taught by communist anti-c
 olonial thinker Aimé Césaire (1913 - 2008).\n\nFanon was exposed to much
  European racism during World War II. After France fell to the Nazis in 19
 40\, a Nazi government was set up in Martinique by French collaborators\, 
 who he described as taking off their masks and behaving like "authentic ra
 cists".\n\nFighting for the Allied forces\, Fanon also observed European w
 omen liberated by black soldiers preferring to dance with fascist Italian 
 prisoners rather than fraternize with their liberators.\n\nWhile completin
 g a residency in psychiatry in France completing\, Fanon wrote and publish
 ed his first book\, "Black Skin\, White Masks" (1952)\, an analysis of the
  negative psychological effects of colonial subjugation upon black people.
 \n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Algerian revolution in November 1954\, F
 anon joined the Front de Libération Nationale\, a nationalist Algerian pa
 rty. Working at a French hospital in Algeria\, Fanon became responsible fo
 r treating the psychological distress of the French troops who carried out
  torture to suppress anti-colonial resistance\, as well as their Algerian 
 victims.\n\nWhile organizing for Algerian independence in Ghana\, Fanon wa
 s diagnosed with the leukemia that would ultimately kill him. He spent the
  last year of his life writing his most famous work\, "The Wretched of the
  Earth" (French: Les Damnés de la Terre). The text provides a psychiatric
  analysis of the dehumanizing effects of colonization and examines the pos
 sibilities of anti-colonial liberation.\n\nFollowing a trip to the Soviet 
 Union to treat his leukemia\, Fanon came to the U.S. in 1961 for further t
 reatment in a visit arranged by the CIA. Fanon died in Bethesda\, Maryland
  on December 6th\, 1961 under the name of "Ibrahim Fanon"\, a Libyan nom d

 compound.\n\nPolice beat and tortured everyone they found. Several people 
 were beaten unconscious\, sexually harassed\, had hair cut from their head

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1978\, thousands of New Jersey postal workers w
 alked off the job after their work contract expired to protest mandatory o
 vertime\, forced speedup\, lack of support from union leadership\, and uns
 afe working conditions. The strike eventually grew to including nearly 5\,
 000 postal workers nationwide\, becoming the largest strike of U.S. federa
 l employees between 1970 and 1981.\n\nThe previous contract\, which set th
 e terms of employment for U.S. postal workers\, had just expired at midnig
 ht on July 20th. Postal management\, the national union leadership\, and t
 he Carter Administration\, had created a new collective agreement which ig
 nored most rank and file postal workers' concerns.\n\nIn Jersey City\, New
  Jersey\, workers at the Bulk and Foreign Mail Center formed the Good Cont
 ract Committee (GCC) to organize a set of demands for the new contract tha
 t reflected the interests of the working class. These activists launched a
  newspaper called P.O.W. (Post Office Worker) and distributed 75\,000 leaf
 lets at local postal facilities.\n\nThe Bulk Jersey City wildcat strike la
 sted for four days in an attempt to nullify the tentative national contrac
 t agreement. It shut down the NJ plant as well as another bulk center in R
 ichmond\, California.\n\nAfter the strike was broken\, 125 workers were fi
 red\, 130 were temporarily suspended\, 2\,500 received letters of warning\
 , and leaders of the walkout were blacklisted. The union did not ratify th
 e proposed work contract\, and an arbitrated contract settlement was impos

 Railroad Strike of 1877\, a national period of strikes and rioting due to 
 economic depression. The St. Louis strike was largely organized by the Kni

  Illinois\, train workers held a secret meeting\, resolving to call for an
  increase in wages and to strike if their demands were not met. The demand
  was made and rejected that same night\, and so\, effective at midnight\, 
 the strike began.\n\nWithin hours\, strikers virtually controlled the city
 . Although the strike was mostly bloodless\, the protesters seized the cit
 y's Union Depot\, stopped freight and some passenger trains from passing t
 hrough the city.\n\nWorkers attacked productive capital\, including flour 
 mills and sugar refineries\, dismantling over forty factories in total. Th

  demonstrations by force five days later.

 in which more than a hundred riots took place across the United States.\n\
 nIn the early hours of July 23rd\, Detroit Police Department (DPD) officer

  store. Shortly thereafter\, full-scale looting began throughout the neigh
 borhood. This looting escalated into a city-wide uprising that involved sh
 ootouts between rioters and police officers.\n\nThe violence escalated thr
 oughout the next day\, resulting in some 483 fires and 1\,800 arrests. Tho
 usands of guns were stolen from stores. Firefighters attempting to put out
  fires were shot at\, police brutality was rampant. Even when thousands of
  federal troops were sent to occupy Detroit\, the rioting could not be que
 lled until July 28th.\n\n43 people were killed in total\, most of whom wer
 e black. Among the dead was a four year old girl named Tanya Blanding\, sh
 ot and killed by Sgt. Mortimer J. LeBlanc after he fired indiscriminately 
 into her mother's apartment. LeBlanc was exonerated by the state.\n\nThe s

DESCRIPTION:Emmett Till\, born on this day in 1941\, was a black child tor
 tured and lynched by white supremacists in Mississippi at 14 years old. Hi
 s killers sold the story of how they murdered him for $4\,000 after being 
 acquitted by an all-white jury.\n\nEmmett was born in Chicago to Mamie Car
 than\, a working class woman from Tallahatchie County\, Mississippi\, wher
 e the average annual income for a black family was $462 (equivalent to $4\
 ,700 in 2016 dollars). In 1955\, Till's great-uncle visited the family in 
 Chicago and told Emmett stories about the Mississippi Delta\, leading Emme
 tt to plan a visit.\n\nTill arrived in Money\, Mississippi\, on August 21s
 t\, 1955. On the 24th\, Till and his friends visited a store owned by a wh
 ite couple. Till was accused of whistling at and approaching the wife\, Ca
 rolyn Bryant\, while at the store.\n\nFacts of Till's interaction with Bry
 ant are disputed\, however many of the accusations - that Till put his han
 ds on Bryant\, that he made lewd comments at her\, or that he bragged to h
 is friends about having had sex with a white woman - have been withdrawn b
 y the people who initially made them. Till's mother has also stated that s
 he taught Emmett to whistle to help with his stutter\, which he developed 
 after a bout with polio.\n\nAfter word broke out that an interaction had t
 aken place between Till and Bryant\, Carolyn's husband\, Roy Bryant\, and 
 his half-brother\, J.W. Milam abducted Emmett\, tortured him\, shot him\, 
 and threw his corpse into the Tallahatchie River. Following Till's disappe
 arance\, civil rights activists Medgar Evers and Amzie Moore went undercov
 er as cotton pickers to try and locate him.\n\nThree days after his abduct
 ion and murder\, Till's swollen and disfigured body was found by two boys 
 who were fishing in the Tallahatchie River. His head was very badly mutila
 ted\, he had been shot above the right ear\, an eye was dislodged from the
  socket\, there was evidence that he had been beaten on the back and the h
 ips\, and his body weighted by a fan blade\, which was fastened around his
  neck with barbed wire.\n\nMamie decided to have an open-casket funeral\, 
 saying: "There was just no way I could describe what was in that box. No w
 ay. And I just wanted the world to see." Tens of thousands of people lined
  the street outside the mortuary to view Till's body\, and days later thou
 sands more attended his funeral at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ.
 \n\nIn the lead-up to Bryant and Milam's trial\, local newspapers falsely 
 reported that there were riots at Till's funeral\, and depicted both men s
 miling in military uniforms. On September 23rd\, 1955\, an all-white\, all
 -male jury (both women and blacks had been explicitly banned) acquitted Br
 yant and Milam after a 67-minute deliberation. One juror said "If we hadn'
 t stopped to drink pop\, it wouldn't have taken that long."\n\nProtected a
 gainst double jeopardy\, Bryant and Milam quickly struck a deal with "Look
 " magazine in 1956 to tell their story for approximately $4\,000 ($35\,000
  in 2016 dollars).\n\nEmmett Till's murder became a flashpoint in the Amer
 ican civil rights movement\; the Montgomery Bus Boycott began in December 
 later that year after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white p
 erson. Parks stated "I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back.
 "\n\nMyrlie Evers\, the widow of Medgar Evers\, said in 1985 that Till's c
 ase resonated so strongly because it "shook the foundations of Mississippi
  - both black and white\, because...with the white community...it had beco
 me nationally publicized...with us as blacks...it said\, even a child was 
 not safe from racism and bigotry and death."

 Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\, where black study participants were
  not told of their syphilitic condition\, given toxic treatments\, and fal
 sely told they were receiving free healthcare from the federal government.
  Lasting from 1932 until 1972\, all of its participants were poor\, rural 
 black men with very limited access to health information.\n\nIn November 1
 966\, Buxtun had filed an official protest on ethical grounds with the PHS
 's "Division of Venereal Diseases" and another protest in November 1968\, 
 however his concerns were dismissed both times. In 1968\, black statistici
 an and PHS employee William Carter Jenkins also called for an end to the s
 tudy in his magazine The Drum.\n\nIt wasn't until Buxtun leaked the story 
 to the Washington Star that the study became public knowledge and a nation
 al scandal. In 1974\, as part of the settlement of a class action lawsuit

DESCRIPTION:The Chicago Railroad Strike of 1877 was a series of work stopp
 ages and civil unrest in Illinois which culminated in a crowd of more than
  10\,000 protesters battling with federal troops on this day that year. Th
 e episode of labor unrest was part of the broader\, national strikes and r

 rious industries began to go on strike\, and Chicago's local government pr
 epared for unrest as other cities across the nation grappled with general 
 strikes and rioting.\n\nLarge crowds\, up to 25\,000 people\, began to gat
 her and demand various labor reforms. On July 26th\, 1877\, violent clashe
 s between protesters and police reached a fever pitch in the "Battle of th
 e Viaduct"\, where cops and members of the crowd exchanged gunfire.\n\nBy 
 that evening\, the police had successfully dispersed crowds throughout the
  city. 14 to 30 rioters were dead or dying\, while between 35 to 100 civil
 ians and 9 to 13 policemen were wounded.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1917\, the "Sixth Party Congress of the Russian
  Social-Democratic Labour Party" began in Petrograd\, wherein the Bolshevi
 k movement formally defined and adopted the Leninist concept of democratic
  centralism.\n\nAlthough the idea of democratic centralism was originally 
 outlined in Vladimir Lenin's "What is To Be Done?" 1902 political pamphlet
 \, it was at this meeting the concept was officially defined and adopted b
 y the Bolsheviks.\n\nThe Congress defined democratic centralism as follows
 :\n\n- That all directing bodies of the Party\, from top to bottom\, shall
  be elected.\n\n- That Party bodies shall give periodical accounts of thei
 r activities to their respective Party organizations.\n\n- That there shal
 l be strict Party discipline and the subordination of the minority to the 
 majority.\n\n- That all decisions of higher bodies shall be absolutely bin
 ding on lower bodies and on all Party members.\n\nThe concept is sometimes
  briefly surmised as "freedom of discussion\, unity of action"\, and was i
 ntended to prevent factions forming within the party. When the Bolsheviks 
 consolidated power following the Russian Civil War\, Lenin and other Bolsh
 evik leaders instituted a ban on factions in the party during the 10th Par
 ty Congress of 1921.\n\nThe concept was widely influential in other commun
 ist movements\; for example\, it was adopted in Article 3 of the Constitut
 ion of the People's Republic of China.\n\nLibertarian socialists have been
  critical of the practice\, with anarchist writer Scott Nappolas calling d
 emocratic centralism "the organizational theory of a rising ruling class".

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1957\, anti-communist Guatemalan leader Carlos 
 Castillo Armas was assassinated by a leftist member of the Presidential Gu
 ard\, causing instability that led to the Guatemalan Civil War\, killing ~
 200\,000 civilians.\n\nArmas had seized power with the aid of the U.S. Cen
 tral Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a 1954 coup against democratically elect
 ed leader Jacobo Árbenz\, ending an almost ten year period of representat
 ive democracy in the country.\n\nÁrbenz was a social reformer whose gover
 nment had instituted\, among many other reforms\, land redistribution\, ea
 rning the ire of the United Fruit Company (UFCO) and the U.S. government.\
 n\nAfter Armas consolidated his power in an October 1954 election in which
  he was the only candidate\, Árbenz's popular agricultural reform was lar
 gely rolled back\, with land confiscated from small farmers and returned t
 o large landowners.\n\nHe also created a National Committee of Defense Aga
 inst Communism\, which investigated over 70\,000 people and added 10% of t
 he population to a list of suspected communists. Armas cracked down on uni
 ons and peasant organizations\, arresting and killing thousands\, often ju
 stifying the repression in the name of anti-communism.\n\nOn July 26th\, 1
 957\, Armas was assassinated by Romeo Vásquez Sánchez\, a member of the 
 presidential guard. After killing Armas\, Sánchez fled into a different r
 oom and committed suicide.\n\nFollowing Armas's death\, a period of violen
 t political instability followed\, with the U.S. backing state forces whil
 e leftist insurgents waged guerilla warfare against the state during the G
 uatemalan Civil War (1960 - 1996).\n\nThe Civil War killed more than 200\,
 000 civilians. Though crimes against civilians were committed by both side
 s\, 93% of these atrocities were committed by the U.S.-backed military\, i
 ncluding a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya p
 opulation during the 1980s. Historians have attributed the violence of the
  civil war to the 1954 coup and the "anti-communist paranoia" that it gene
 rated.

 n December 31st\, 1958\, replacing his government with a revolutionary soc

 Leninist lines\, becoming the Communist Party in October of 1965.\n\nThe C
 uban Revolution had powerful domestic and international repercussions. In 
 particular\, it made Cuba's relationship with the United States\, which ha

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1936\, an international conference was held in 
 Prague to arrange assistance for revolutionary Spanish Republicans\, leadi

 nal immediately reinforced its activity sending to Spain its leader Georgi
  Dimitrov\, as well as Palmiro Togliti\, the chief of the Communist Party 
 of Italy.\n\nFrom August onward\, aid was sent from Russia: more than one 
 ship a day arrived at Spain's Mediterranean ports carrying munitions\, rif
 les\, machine guns\, hand grenades\, artillery\, trucks\, and Soviet agent
 s and technicians.\n\nThe conference led to the formation of international
  brigades of volunteer forces\, including the American Lincoln Battalion (
 shown). Similar groups included the George Washington Battalion and the Jo
 hn Brown Battery (both American)\, while Latin American and Irish troops f
 ormed the Centuria Guttieras and the Connolly Column\, respectively.\n\nAl
 though the politics of the Lincoln Battalion skewed to the left\, the one 
 unifying trait of those who joined was a hatred for fascism. They were als
 o inexperienced and not well trained\, suffering heavy casualties during t

 ill waiting for a detailed explanation of what has this international stru
 ggle to do with my being here. Since this is a war between whites who for

 lesale imprisonment\, and slaughter which the Jewish people suffered and a

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1909\, a general strike broke out in Catalonia 
 to protest conscription imposed by the Spanish government. The government 
 declared a state of war and put down the rebellion with the Army\, killing
  more than 100 civilians. The series of clashes between working class radi

 s immediate cause was Premier Antonio Maura attempting to bring out reserv

 n Morocco. Many of these reservists were the only breadwinners for their f
 amilies\, while the wealthy were able to hire substitutes.\n\nThese action
 s\, coupled with anarchist\, anti-militarist\, and anti-colonial philosoph
 ies shared by many in the city\, resulted in the calling of a general stri
 ke against Maura's attempt at conscription. By the next day\, workers had 
 occupied much of central Barcelona\, halting troop trains and overturning 
 trams. Just a few days later\, there was street fighting\, with a general 
 eruption of riots\, strikes\, and the burning of convents.\n\nThe Spanish 
 government declared a "state of war" and used the national army to put dow
 n the rebellion by force. Over one hundred civilians were killed and more 
 than 1\,700 individuals were indicted in military courts for "armed rebell
 ion".

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1918\, Canadian socialist and labor activist Al
 bert "Ginger" Goodwin was murdered by police while avoiding his draft into
  World War I by hiding out in the hills of Cumberland\, British Columbia.\
 n\nBorn in Yorkshire\, England on May 10th\, 1887\, Goodwin immigrated to 
 Canada in 1909\, at the age of 19\, working as a coal miner in Nova Scotia
 .\n\nIn Canada\, he organized with the Socialist Party of Canada and becam
 e a notable labor leader during the 1912–1914 Coal Miner's Strike agains
 t Canadian Collieries. Following the strike\, he was blacklisted and was f
 orced to move away from Cumberland to find work.\n\nIn 1916\, he joined th
 e Mining and Smelter workers Union and was elected as Secretary for the Tr
 ail chapter. Following his involvement with trade unions\, Goodwin entered
  politics running as a candidate for the Socialist Party of Canada in the 
 1916 British Columbian election\, although he did not win.\n\nAs World War
  I broke out\, Goodwin became an outspoken advocate against the draft\, in
 itially refusing to sign up. Eventually\, he was compelled to be drafted\,
  and\, after exhausting multiple appeals against his conscription\, he fle
 d into the hills of Cumberland\, British Columbia.\n\nOn July 27th (some s
 ources say July 26th)\, Goodwin was shot and killed by a member of the Dom
 inion Police\, who had ventured into the hills surrounding Comox Lake to l
 ocate men evading the draft and arrest them for their evasion. The officer
  who killed Goodwin successfully claimed self-defense in court\, although 
 it is unknown how the two actually encountered each other.\n\nIn protest t
 o his murder\, the first general strike in Canada\, the Vancouver General 
 Strike\, took place on August 2nd\, 1918. In 2015\, a film about his life 
 titled "Goodwin's Way" was released.\n\n"War is simply part of the process
  of Capitalism. Big financial interests are playing the game. They'll reap
  the victory\, no matter how the war ends."\n\n- Albert Goodwin

 manned by free black men\, fugitive slaves\, and Seminole warriors\, killi
 ng hundreds.\n\nWhen withdrawing at the end of the War of 1812\, the Briti
 sh Commander Edward Nicolls intentionally left the fully-armed fort in the
  hands of troops that were largely free black men and fugitive slaves. Als
 o at the Fort were Creek and Choctaw allies who had served alongside the B
 ritish during the war.\n\nAs Nicolls hoped\, the fort\, near the Southern 
 border of the United States\, became a center and symbol of resistance to 
 American slavery. The "Negro Fort" was the largest instance before the Ame
 rican Civil War in which fugitive slaves took up arms against the U.S. gov
 ernment that sought to enslave them.\n\nOn July 27th\, American forces act
 ing on orders from General Andrew Jackson committed to an all-out attack a
 gainst the fort. From a boat on the river\, the American forces used red-h
 ot shot\, trying to start a fire. A shot landed in the powder magazine\, w
 hich ignited\, blowing up the fort and killing over 270 people instantly.\
 n\nCaptured black survivors were re-enslaved in Georgia. The largest group
  of survivors took refuge further south\, in Angola\, Florida. Others foun
 ded Nicholls Town in the Bahamas.\n\nSecretary of State John Quincy Adams 
 later justified the attack and subsequent seizure of Spanish Florida by An
 drew Jackson as national "self-defense". Seminole anger at the U.S. for th
 e fort's destruction contributed to the breakout of the First Seminole War
  a year later.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1932\, Washington D.C. police and the U.S. Army
  battled with WWI veterans camped out at the capitol who were demanding ea

 r families and affiliated groups\, who gathered in Washington\, D.C. in mi
 d-1932 to demand early cash redemption of their service certificates.\n\nM
 ost of the Bonus Army camped in a "Hooverville" on the Anacostia Flats\, a
  swampy\, muddy area across the Anacostia River from the federal core of W
 ashington (now Section C of Anacostia Park). Approximately 10\,000 veteran
 s\, women and children lived in the shelters\, built from materials dragge
 d out of a junk pile nearby\, including old lumber\, packing boxes\, and s
 crap tin\, which covered roofs of thatched straw.\n\nOn this day in 1932\,
  President Hoover ordered the Secretary of War to disperse the protesters.
  When the veterans returned after being pushed out the first time\, police
  fired on them\, killing two. Federal troops were called in and\, armed wi
 th bayonets and tear gas\, they moved to evict the Bonus Army by force.\n\
 nIn the mayhem that followed\, 55 veterans were injured\, 135 were arreste
 d\, and one three month old baby died. The incident was politically disast
 rous for President Hoover\, who lost the election that year to Franklin De
 lano Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1933\, another Bonus Army marched on Washington D.C.
 \, but FDR\, perhaps learning from his predecessor's mistakes\, created a 
 camp for the soldiers and fed them. He offered the veterans jobs with the 
 Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)\, and those who chose not to work for th

COMMENT:Hugo Chávez\, born on this day in 1954\, was a socialist leader o
 f Venezuela\, serving as the country's President from 1999 to 2013. Over t
 hat period\, Chávez's government abolished illiteracy and codified health
 care as a human right.
DESCRIPTION:Hugo Chávez\, born on this day in 1954\, was a socialist lead
 er of Venezuela\, serving as the country's President from 1999 - 2013. Dur
 ing that period\, Chávez's government abolished illiteracy and codified h
 ealthcare as a human right.\n\nChávez was born to schoolteachers in the r
 ural village of Sabaneta. While serving in the Venezuelan military as a yo
 ung man\, Chávez began reading Marxist literature which had been left beh
 ind by leftist insurgents his unit had been tasked with dispatching. By ag
 e 21\, he came to recognize the need for a leftist government in Venezuela
 .\n\nIn 1982\, while still active in the military\, Chávez founded the Re
 volutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (EBR-200)\, inspired by Latin American
  revolutionaries Ezequiel Zamora\, Simón Bolívar\, and Simón Rodríguez
 .\n\nIn 1992\, EBR-200 attempted a coup to oust President Carlos Andrés P
 érez\, who had reneged on campaign promises and begun instituting economi
 c policies of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The coup attempt fail
 ed\, killing fourteen people. Although Chávez was imprisoned\, this incid
 ent helped him become a symbol of anti-corruption for working class Venezu
 elans.\n\nIn 1994\, Chávez was pardoned by President Rafael Caldera and w
 ent on a 100-day speaking tour\, promoting the Bolivarian cause of social 
 revolution. He visited Argentina\, Uruguay\, Chile\, Colombia\, and Cuba\,
  befriending Fidel Castro.\n\nIn 1998\, Chávez won an election for the Ve
 nezuelan Presidency with 56% of the vote\, promising widespread social and
  economic reforms. He would go on to serve as President from 1999 until hi
 s death from cancer in 2013 at age 58.\n\nIn 2002\, Chávez fired executiv
 es of the state-run oil company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Foll
 owing violent protests between anti- and pro- government forces\, the Vene
 zuelan military attempted a coup\, kidnapping Chávez. This was met with a
  massive pro-Chávez uprising from the public\, and he was re-instated to 
 power after just 47 hours.\n\nChávez's government succeeded in abolishing
  illiteracy\, expanding access to social services such as healthcare and e
 ducation\, and established rights that protected indigenous cultural pract
 ices.\n\nChávez was subjected to particularly vehement criticism from lib
 eral institutions and intellectuals. British Trotskyist Alan Woods wrote t
 hat the "media campaign of vilification against Chávez had no precedent i
 n modern history". Some of this criticism comes from institutions such as 
 the "Freedom House"\, a majority U.S. government funded think tank based o
 ut of Washington D.C.\, and "Bloomberg"\, a newspaper named after and majo
 rity controlled by American oligarch Michael Bloomberg.\n\n"The capitalist
  model\, the developed model\, the consumer model which comes from the Nor
 th\, which it has forced on the world\, is falling apart on Earth\, and th
 ere is no planet nearby that we can emigrate to."\n\n- Hugo Chávez

  suffragette activism while traveling in Britain\, becoming employed by an
 d organizing with the Women's Social and Political Union.\n\nWorking with 
 her friend Alice Paul\, Burns engaged in multiple acts of rebellion while 
 in Britain\, getting arrested and force-fed when attempting to hunger stri
 ke. When Burns refused to open her mouth\, the feeding tube was inserted u
 p her nostril\, causing severe nosebleeds.\n\nOne incident involving Burns
  and Paul that led to such treatment was crashing the London Lord Mayor's 
 Ball\, mingling with guests before approaching Winston Churchill with a hi
 dden banner shouting "How can you dine here while women are starving in pr
 ison?"\n\nBurns and other suffrage activists in the U.S. successfully got 
 Congress to vote on a women's suffrage amendment in 1918\, however it narr
 owly failed in the Senate. It was later passed and officially ratified on 
 August 18th\, 1920.\n\nAfter achieving this goal\, Burns stated "I don't w
 ant to do anything more. I think we have done all this for women\, and we 
 have sacrificed everything we possessed for them\, and now let them fight 
 for it now. I am not going to fight anymore" and retired from public life.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1915\, the U.S. occupation of Haiti began when\
 , on orders from President Woodrow Wilson\, 330 Marines landed at Port-au-
 Prince after the country's leader was assassinated. The imperialist occupa
 tion lasted until 1934.\n\nHaiti had already been suffering from U.S. impe
 rialism and political turmoil prior to the invasion. In 1914\, U.S. Marine
 s stole $500\,000 in gold from the country's National Bank. Haiti's leader
 \, President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam\, had also recently been killed by insu
 rgents angered by state-sanctioned murders of his political opposition.\n\
 nPresident Wilson ordered the invasion to "protect American and foreign" i
 nterests and also wanted to rewrite the Haitian constitution\, which banne
 d foreign ownership of land\, and replace it with one that guaranteed Amer
 ican financial control. To avoid public criticism\, Wilson claimed the occ
 upation was a mission to "re-establish peace and order...and has nothing t
 o do with any diplomatic negotiations of the past or the future".\n\nWhen 
 the Haitian legislature refused to ratify a new constitution that allowed 
 foreigners to own land there\, the U.S.-backed President Dartiguenave diss
 olved the legislature and the constitution became law. U.S. occupiers also
  re-instituted a system of slavery known as civil conscription ("impressed
  labor")\, in which Haitian civilians were captured and forced to work on 
 public projects and established the National Guard.\n\nThe U.S. military o
 ccupation of Haiti continued until August 15th\, 1934. According to the U.
 S. State Department's Office of the Historian\, the invasion's result was 
 this: "The United States gained complete control over Haitian finances\, a
 nd the right to intervene in Haiti whenever the U.S. Government deemed nec
 essary."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1914\, prominent French socialist Jean Jaurès 
 was assassinated by a nationalist at the outbreak of World War I after ret
 urning from a diplomatic meeting in Brussels where he had advocated agains
 t the coming war.\n\nInitially a moderate republican\, Jaurès was later o
 ne of the first social democrats\, eventually becoming the leader of the F
 rench Socialist Party\, which opposed Jules Guesde's revolutionary Sociali
 st Party of France. The two parties merged in 1905 in the French Section o
 f the Workers' International (SFIO).\n\nToday\, a key aspect of his legacy
  is his anti-militarism. Jaurès was an early opponent of the draft and de
 sperately tried to prevent war between France and Germany before World War
  I\, going so far as to try and organize a general strike in both countrie
 s to force their leaders to negotiate diplomatically.\n\nIn 1914\, Jaurès
  returned to Paris from a diplomatic meeting in Brussels to advocate again
 st the coming war. He was assassinated by a French nationalist at the outb
 reak of World War I\, and remains a key figure in the history of the Frenc
 h Left.\n\n"Tradition does not mean to look after the ash\, but to keep th
 e flame alive."\n\n- Jean Jaurès

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1905\, Matumbi tribesmen in colonial German Eas
 t Africa (modern Tanzania) destroyed cotton crops and a trading post in th
 e city of Samanga\, beginning the Maji Maji Rebellion. German repression k
 illed 250\,000-300\,000 people.\n\nThe Maji Maji Rebellion (Swahili: "Vita
  vya Maji Maji")\, was an armed rebellion of Islamic and Animist Africans 
 against German colonial rule\, triggered by a colonial policy designed to 
 force the indigenous population to grow cotton for export.\n\nIn the days 
 leading up to the rebellion\, a spirit medium named Kinjikitile Ngwale dev
 eloped a belief that the people of German East Africa had been called upon
  to eliminate the Germans. After the Matumbi tribesmen attacked Samanga\, 
 Kinjikitile was arrested. Before being executed\, he stated that he had al
 ready spread the "medicine of rebellion" throughout the region.\n\nThe res
 ulting war lasted two years\, with the Germans successfully putting the re
 bellion down by force. As a means to weaken the rebellion\, German soldier
 s deliberately orchestrated a famine by destroying available food sources\
 , devastating the region and killing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nS
 uch was the scale of this destruction that\, in 1953\, journalist John Gun
 ther noted "even today the Southern Province of Tanganyika\, the 'Cinderel
 la Province\,' has not fully recovered from the German terror half a centu
 ry ago. The economy of the region has never been successfully rebuilt".\n\
 nAlthough Tanzania demanded reparations from Germany for these atrocities 
 in 2017\, the German government has not paid them as of July 2021.

 the Mürzsteg reforms\, which provided for foreign policing of the Macedon

  little to solve the crisis\, and the Empire lost nearly all of its Europe
 an territory in the Balkan Wars of 1912-13.\n\nToday\, August 2nd is a nat

  but ordinary Turkish villagers as well. Our only enemies are the Turkish 
 authorities\, those who use arms against us\, betray us\, or who carry out
  acts of retaliation against helpless old people\, women and children rath

 is faced can be changed\, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."\n
 \nBaldwin is known for\, among many other works\, his first novel "Go Tell
  It on the Mountain" (1953)\, the non-fiction text "The Fire Next Time" (1
 963)\, and the unfinished manuscript "Remember This House"\, later adapted
  into the film "I Am Not Your Negro" by Raoul Peck.\n\nIn 1963\, Baldwin c
 onducted a lecture tour of the South for the Congress of Racial Equality (
 CORE)\, traveling to places like Durham and Greensboro in North Carolina\,
  and New Orleans\, Louisiana.\n\nDuring the tour\, Baldwin lectured to stu
 dents\, white liberals\, and others about his thinking on matters of race\
 , an ideological position between the "muscular approach" of Malcolm X and
  the non-violent program of Martin Luther King\, Jr according to Baldwin b
 iographer David Leeming.\n\nIn 1965\, Baldwin debated and defeated conserv
 ative William F. Buckley at Cambridge University on the motion of "Has the
  American Dream been achieved at the expense of the American Negro?"\, sta
 ting "I am stating this very seriously\, and this is not an overstatement 
 - I picked the cotton\, and I carried it to market\, and I built the railr
 oads\, under someone else's whip\, for nothing. For nothing."\n\nBaldwin w
 as also an anti-capitalist who expressed hope that socialism would take ro
 ot in the United States. In 1972\, when asked "Do you think socialism will
  ever come to the U.S.A.?"\, Baldwin replied:\n\n"I would think so. I don'
 t see any other way for it to go. But then you have to be very careful wha
 t you mean by socialism. When I use the word I'm not thinking about Lenin 
 for example...Bobby Seale talks about a Yankee Doodle-type socialism...So 
 that a socialism achieved in America\, if and when we do...will be a socia
 lism very unlike the Chinese socialism or the Cuban socialism...\n\n...the
  price of any real socialism here is the eradication of what we call the r
 ace problem...Racism is crucial to the system to keep blacks and whites at
  a division so both were and are a source of cheap labor."\n\nAfter the as
 sassination of Dr. Martin Luther King\, Baldwin moved to Europe permanentl
 y\, passing away in France on December 1st\, 1987.\n\n"Not everything that
  is faced can be changed\, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."\

DESCRIPTION:Roger Casement was a human rights journalist and Irish revolut
 ionary who was executed on this day in 1916 by the British state for treas
 on after trying to acquire military aid for Irish Republicans before the E
 aster Rising. Casement's work in the first decade of the 20th century expo
 sed imperialist atrocities in the Congo and Peru.\n\nCasement began his ca
 reer working for Henry Morton Stanley and the African International Associ
 ation\, a front for King Leopold II of Belgium in his efforts to colonize 
 the Congo.\n\nIn 1890\, Casement met author Joseph Conrad\, who had come t
 o the Congo to pilot a merchant ship. According to author Liesl Schillinge
 r\, both were inspired by the idea that "European colonisation would bring
  moral and social progress to the continent and free its inhabitants 'from
  slavery\, paganism and other barbarities.' Each would soon learn the grav
 ity of his error."\n\nIn 1904\, Casement published the "Casement Report"\,
  which\, via interviews with workers\, overseers\, and mercenaries\, expos
 ed the enslavement\, mutilation\, and torture of natives on the rubber pla
 ntations. The report caused an international scandal and led to the creati
 on of various reform organizations in the West.\n\nA few years later\, Cas
 ement traveled to the Putumayo District in South America\, where rubber wa
 s being harvested in the Amazon Basin\, and exposed the treatment of indig
 enous people in Peru. Finding conditions just as inhumane as what he witne
 ssed in the Congo\, Casement interviewed both the Putumayo and men who had
  abused them\, publishing his findings in a first-person narrative that ag
 ain caused an international scandal.\n\nIn November\, 1914 Casement helped
  form the Irish Volunteers. He traveled to both the United States and Germ
 any to both promote the Irish nationalist cause and acquire aid for it.\n\
 nIn 1916\, Casement was captured by the British government and charged wit
 h high treason after he attempted to acquire military aid from Germany to 
 aid the Irish nationalist cause. During trial proceedings\, the government
  secretly circulated alleged excerpts from Casement's journals\, the "Blac
 k Diaries"\, which detailed sexual acts with other men. The authenticity o
 f these documents is still debated today.\n\nCasement was hanged at Penton
 ville Prison on August 3rd\, 1916 at 51 years old.\n\n"Self government is 
 our right\, a thing born to us at birth a thing no more to be doled out to
  us by another people then the right to life itself then the right to feel
  the sun or smell the flowers or to love our kind."\n\n- Roger Casement

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1945\, the U.S. military dropped a nuclear bomb
  on Hiroshima\, instantly killing at least 80\,000 people - mostly civilia
 ns - and tens of thousands more over the following weeks. The U.S. censore
 d images of the bombing until 1952.\n\nEye-witness accounts of the bombing
 's aftermath depicted a kind of apocalyptic horror: Father Wilhelm Kleinso
 rge\, a German Jesuit priest\, encountered a group of soldiers whose "face
 s were wholly burned\, their eye-sockets were hollow\, the fluid from thei
 r melted eyes had run down their cheeks... Their mouths were mere swollen\
 , pus-covered wounds\, which they could not bear to stretch enough to admi
 t the spout of the teapot."\n\nDr. Michihiko Hachiya\, a survivor\, spoke 
 of "streetcars were standing and inside were dozens of bodies\, blackened 
 beyond recognition. I saw fire reservoirs filled to the brim with dead bod
 ies who looked as they had been boiled alive".\n\nPresident Harry Truman m
 ade the case to the public that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as 
 a necessary and humanitarian means of forcing Japan's surrender. This view
  was not held\, however\, by military commanders or leftist American dissi
 dents.\n\nOnce American forces had Japan under military control\, they imp
 osed censorship on many images related to the U.S. bombing campaign. Among
  the images banned was a picture of a partially incinerated Nagasaki child
 \, taken by Japanese photographer Yōsuke Yamahata. These restrictions wer
 e not lifted until 1952.\n\nAmong the first Americans to denounce the bomb
 ing were socialists such as the Trotskyist James P. Cannon\, who publicly 
 denounced the use of nuclear weapons as "an unspeakable atrocity".\n\nThe 
 dissent of military commanders was not public\, however. In 1950\, Admiral
  William Leahy\, Truman's chief of staff\, wrote: "The use of this barbaro
 us weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our w
 ar against Japan". In his memoirs\, President Eisenhower\, then General of
  the Army\, confessed that "dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary".

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1865\, freedman Jourdon Anderson (1825 - 1907) 
 wrote a humorous and pointed response to decline the request of his former
  master to return to the plantation\, which had fallen into disrepair afte
 r the Civil War.\n\nThe letter's dry wit has been compared to the style of
  Mark Twain\, and it became an immediate sensation\, becoming published in
  the press a few weeks later.\n\nJourdon had been enslaved since he was a 
 child in Wilson County\, Tennessee\, working the plantation of the Anderso
 n family. In 1864\, Union Army soldiers camped on the Anderson plantation 
 and freed him. Subsequently\, he moved to Dayton\, Ohio with his family\, 
 finding work as a sexton with the Wesleyan Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1865\, 
 he received a letter from Colonel P.H. Anderson\, his former master\, who 
 requested that Jourdon return to the plantation in a last-ditch to save th
 e farm\, which had fallen into disrepair after the Civil War.\n\nOn August
  7th\, 1865\, Jourdon dictated his response. Here are some excerpts (the l
 etter in full is linked below):\n\n"I got your letter\, and was glad to fi
 nd that you had not forgotten Jourdon\, and that you wanted me to come bac
 k and live with you again\, promising to do better for me than anybody els
 e can. I have often felt uneasy about you. I thought the Yankees would hav
 e hung you long before this\, for harboring Rebs they found at your house.
 \n\n...[My wife and I] have concluded to test your sincerity by asking you
  to send us our wages for the time we served you...I served you faithfully
  for thirty-two years\, and Mandy twenty years. At twenty-five dollars a m
 onth for me\, and two dollars a week for Mandy\, our earnings would amount
  to eleven thousand six hundred and eighty dollars.\n\nAdd to this the int
 erest for the time our wages have been kept back\, and deduct what you pai
 d for our clothing\, and three doctor's visits to me\, and pulling a tooth
  for Mandy\, and the balance will show what we are in justice entitled to.
  Please send the money by Adams's Express\, in care of V. Winters\, Esq.\,
  Dayton\, Ohio. If you fail to pay us for faithful labors in the past\, we
  can have little faith in your promises in the future.\n\n...P.S.—Say ho
 wdy to George Carter\, and thank him for taking the pistol from you when y
 ou were shooting at me."\n\nJourdon's offer was declined\, and he continue
 d to live in Dayton\, dying there at the age of 81 in 1907. Colonel Anders
 on\, having failed to attract his former slaves back\, sold the land for a
  pittance to try to get out of debt\, dying two years later.\n\nPrior to 2
 006\, historian Raymond Winbush tracked down the living relatives of the C
 olonel Anderson\, reporting that they "are still angry at Jordan for not c
 oming back"\, knowing that the plantation was in serious disrepair after t
 he war.

 throughout the country demanding multi-party democracy from the ruling one
 -party state. Over the following days\, the mass demonstrations devolved i

 8888 Uprising\, also known as the People Power Uprising\, took place in th
 e context of an economic crisis in the country\, governed as a one-party s

 ainst various state economic policies since 1985.\n\nOn August 8th\, 1988 
 (thus the uprising's name) mass anti-government demonstrations took place 
 throughout the country. Participants came from a wide variety of demograph

 e casualty reported on the first day\, the result of a frightened traffic 
 cop who fired into the crowd and fled. Over the next few days\, the protes
 ts devolved into violent riots as the military and police fired on the pro
 testers\, at one point even shooting doctors and nurses tending to the wou

  burned a police station and killed four fleeing police officers.\n\nOn Au

 re ignored by the military government and she was arrested.\n\nOn Septembe

  repealing the 1974 constitution and imposing martial law. The demonstrati

 sis on liberation for Puerto Ricans and other colonized people. The group 
 was founded in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago\, Illinois on Sept
 ember 23rd\, 1968\, one hundred years after the Grito de Lares uprising. J
 iménez was born to jíbaro parents in Caguas\, Puerto Rico\, but spent hi
 s formative years in Chicago.\n\nIn the summer of 1968\, he was picked up 
 for a possession of heroin charge and given a 60-day sentence at Cook Coun
 ty Jail. While in jail\, he read "The Seven Story Mountain" by Thomas Mert

  such as MLK Jr. and Malcolm X.\n\nAfter his release\, Jiménez transforme
 d the Young Lords from a street gang into a human rights organization\, en
 tering into the "Rainbow Coalition" with Fred Hampton\, head of the BPP's 
 Chicago chapter. After Hampton's assassination by the Chicago Police and F
 BI\, and the Coalition's dissolution\, Jiménez continued his activism\, r
 unning for a Chicago Alderman position in 1975\, and helping organize a vo
 ter registration drive to support Harold Washington's 1982-83 mayoral camp
 aign.\n\nWhen asked in a 2018 interview what happened to the Young Lords\,
  Jiménez responded:\n\n"The question is what happened to the white left\,
  who decided to abandon the Black Panthers and Young Lords when things got
  hot\, as if these groups who risked everything were just\, some kind of a
  fad or that their movement was just some kind of entertainment...\n\n...W
 e will always be reminded of how COINTELPRO and others have worked to spli
 t our movement so that we cannot organize together to free our nation of P
 uerto Rico. We will always work for unity. 'Unidos venceremos' or 'United 
 will win!' It is not just a saying for us. It is a goal."\n\n"If the Peopl
 e of El Salvador can ask for self-determination\, if the People of Nicarag
 ua can ask for self-determination\, if the People of Ireland can ask for s
 elf-determination\, if the People of Poland can ask for self-determination
 \, if Black People in America can stand up and demand self-determination\,
  then Puerto Ricans demand self-determination." \n\n- José Cha Cha Jimén

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1680\, indigenous Pueblo peoples of present-day
  New Mexico rose in rebellion against Spanish colonizers in what is now ca
 lled the "Pueblo Revolt"\, driving Spanish settlers out of the area for tw
 elve years.\n\nAccording to the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center\, the Pueblo
  Revolt of 1680 was the only successful Native uprising against a colonizi
 ng power in North America.\n\nSpain first claimed the region in the 16th c
 entury\, subjecting Puebloans to episodes of colonial violence and displac
 ement. The Spanish demanded payment of heavy tribute from indigenous commu
 nities and destroyed ceremonial buildings in an attempt to eradicate indig
 enous beliefs and impose Christianity.\n\nDuring the 1670s\, conflict inte
 nsified as famine put the communities there in direct competition for scar
 ce resources. In one incident\, 47 Pueblo medicine men were arrested by Sp
 anish forces in 1675 under charges of "sorcery".\n\nBy 1680\, one of the a
 rrested men\, Po’Pay\, had met with several Pueblo leaders and formed a 
 military alliance. Although Po’Pay is often cited as the leader of the r
 ebellion\, it is likely there were several other instrumental organizers w
 ho played an important role in its fruition.\n\nThe date of a cross-Pueblo
  revolt was set for August 11th\, with time being kept at each Pueblo by u
 ntying a knot from a cord everyday until all the knots had been untied. Sp
 anish forces\, however\, learned of the revolt on August 9th after capturi
 ng two messengers from Tesuque. As a result\, Po’Pay ordered military ac
 tion a day early\, on August 10th.\n\nPueblo rebels quickly succeeding in 
 sealing off roads\, destroying colonial settlements\, and laying siege to 
 the regional capital of Santa Fe.\n\nIn total\, Puebloans killed 400 Spani
 ards and drove the remaining 2\,000 settlers out of the area. On August 21
 st\, New Mexico governor Antonio de Otermín fled\, leading a southward re
 treat out of the region.\n\nWith the Spanish gone\, Po’Pay traveled the 
 region\, promoting the revival of indigenous beliefs and destroying church
 es and other symbols of Catholicism in the region. Pueblos largely returne
 d to communal self-governance after the flight of the Spanish.\n\nSpanish 
 colonizers attempted to retake the Pueblos in 1681\, 1688\, and 1689\, fin
 ally succeeding in 1692.

  Manhattan\, New York City took over the prison after multiple warnings ab
 out falling budgets\, aging facilities\, and rising prison populations wer
 e ignored by the city.\n\nThe situation was so dire that union correctiona
 l officers had initiated an informational picket of City Hall to protest t
 he living conditions. Overcrowding was so severe that more than 2\,000 peo
 ple were being held in space meant for less than a 1\,000.\n\nOn August 10
 th\, 1970\, prisoners seized control of the entire ninth floor of the faci
 lity\, taking several officers hostage for eight hours\, until state offic
 ials agreed to hear prisoner grievances and take no punitive action agains
 t the rioters.\n\nDespite that promise\, Mayor John Lindsay had the leader
 s behind the action shipped upstate to the state's Attica Correctional Fac
 ility\, possibly contributing to the Attica Prison riot about a year later
 .\n\nThe August uprising preceded another rebellion in Tombs Prison in Oct
 ober later that year. Inmates again seized staff as hostages and made dema
 nds to improve their living conditions\, such as more education\, lower ba
 il\, and an "inmate council" to mediate prisoner complaints.\n\nAfter the 
 October uprising\, NYC Commissioner of Correction George McGrath fired two
  black guards at the Tombs\, both of whom had reported abuse of inmates by
  other guards and expressed sympathy for the prisoners' cause.\n\nFollowin
 g the August uprising\, the New York City Legal Aid Society filed a class 
 action suit on behalf of pre-trial detainees held in the Tombs. The city d
 ecided to close the facility on December 20th\, 1974 after years of litiga
 tion and a federal judge declaring that the prison's conditions were bad e
 nough to be considered unconstitutional.

COMMENT:On this day in 1965\, the Watts Riots began in Los Angeles after p

  uprising was the largest in city history\, with 3\,438 arrests and $40 mi

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1965\, the Watts Riots began in Los Angeles aft
 er police beat Marquette Fry and his family after he was pulled over for d
 runk driving. The uprising was the largest in city history until the Rodne
 y King riots of 1992\, with 34 deaths and $40 million in property damage a
 cross a 46 square mile (119 square km) stretch of L.A.\n\nThe uprising too
 k place in the context of a highly racialized city\, with severely discrim
 inatory housing\, educational\, and economic practices. The community of W
 atts was predominantly black and regularly suffered brutality at the hands
  of police.\n\nAfter Marquette\, along with his brother and mother\, were 
 beaten and arrested by police\, an angry mob formed and riots broke out. F
 or the next six days\, rioters clashed with police and armed National Guar
 dsmen\, who had been sent by the thousands to suppress the uprising.\n\nLo
 s Angeles Chief of Police William Parker (incidentally\, Parker also coine
 d the phrase "thin blue line" around this time) compared the rioters to th
 e Viet Cong\, promising a "paramilitary" response to the disorder. One off
 icer later stated "The streets of Watts resembled an all-out war zone in s
 ome far-off foreign country\, it bore no resemblance to the United States 
 of America."\n\nBetween 31\,000 and 35\,000 people participated in the rio
 ts\, while 70\,000 people were "sympathetic\, but not active" according to
  John H. Barnhill. Over the six days of rioting\, there were 34 deaths (23
  of which were the result of police shootings)\, 1\,032 injuries\, 3\,438 
 arrests\, and over $40 million in property damage.\n\nFollowing the uprisi
 ng's suppression\, a wave of white flight occurred in surrounding areas\, 
 leading to significant demographic changes in areas such as Compton and Hu
 ntington Park.\n\nA government committee known as the McCone Commission co
 ncluded that the cause of the riots was primarily socio-economic\, and rec
 ommended reforms along these lines. Most of these recommendations were not
  adopted.\n\n"The whole point of the outbreak in Watts was that it marked 
 the first major rebellion of Negroes against their own masochism and was c
 arried on with the express purpose of asserting that they would no longer 
 quietly submit to the deprivation of slum life."\n\n- Bayard Rustin

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1918\, a meeting of women at Willesden bus gara
 ge decided to go on strike without informing their bosses or unions\, begi
 nning the London Women Transport Workers' Strike\, in which they demanded 
 equal pay for equal work.\n\nIn August 1918\, female tram conductors in Wi
 llesden\, London started a wildcat strike which quickly spread around the 
 country and to other sectors of public transport. Earlier that year\, male
  workers were given a 5 shilling per week wartime bonus to help cope with 
 the increased cost of living\, but women workers were not.\n\nOn August 16
 th\, 1918\, a meeting of women at Willesden bus garage decided to go on st
 rike the following day\, without informing their bosses or unions. Initial
 ly demanding the same war bonus that had been given to men\, their demands
  morphed into equal pay\, more than forty years before the Equal Pay Act. 
 The slogan of the strike was "Same Work - Same Pay".\n\nThe strike spread 
 throughout the city - an estimated 18\,000 out of a total 27\,000 women wo
 rking in the public transport industry participated.\n\nThe strike was set
 tled on the 25th of August. The women won the 5 shilling war bonus\, but n
 ot equal pay. According to historian Dr. Cathy Hunt\, this labor action wa
 s "an important step along the way to full gender equality".

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 2012\, the Marikana Massacre took place when So
 uth African police fired on striking workers\, killing 34 and injuring 76 
 in the most lethal use of force by the state in half a century.\n\nThe sho
 otings have been compared to the infamous Sharpeville Massacre in 1960\, w
 hen police fired on a crowd of anti-Pass Law protesters\, killing 69 peopl
 e\, including 10 children. The Marikana Massacre took place on the 25-year
  anniversary of a nationwide strike by over 300\,000 South African workers
 .\n\nOn August 10th\, miners had initiated a wildcat strike at a site owne
 d by Lonmin in the Marikana area\, close to Rustenburg\, South Africa. Alt
 hough ten people (mostly workers) had been killed before August 16th\, it 
 was on that day that an elite force from the South African Police Service 
 fired into a crowd of strikers with rifles\, killing 34 and injuring 76.\n
 \nAfter surveying the aftermath of the violence\, photojournalist Greg Mar
 inovich concluded that "[it is clear] that heavily armed police hunted dow
 n and killed the miners in cold blood."\n\nFollowing the massacre\, a mass
 ive wave of strikes occurred across the South African mining sector - in e
 arly October\, analysts estimated that approximately 75\,000 miners were o
 n strike from various gold and platinum mines and companies across South A
 frica\, most of them doing so illegally.\n\nA year after the Marikana Mass
 acre\, author Benjamin Fogel wrote "Perhaps the most important lesson of M
 arikana is that the state can gun down dozens of black workers with little
  or no backlash from 'civil society'\, the judicial system or from within 
 the institutions that supposedly form the bedrock of democracy."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1819\, the Peterloo Massacre took place when Br
 itish cavalry charged a crowd of ~60\,000 protesters gathered in St. Peter
 's Field in Manchester\, England to demand democratic reforms\, killing 18
  people and wounding hundreds more.\n\nThe protest took place in the conte
 xt of an economic crisis and harvest failure following the end of the Napo
 leonic Wars in 1815. At the time\, only approximately 11% of adult males c
 ould vote\, very few of them in the industrial north\, which was the worst
  hit by the crises.\n\nReformers\, led by figures such as the radical orat
 or Henry Hunt and social reformer Samuel Bamford\, identified democratic a
 nd parliamentary reforms as a way to mobilize the masses\, acquiring three
 -quarters of a million signatures in 1817\, a proposal flatly rejected by 
 the House of Commons.\n\nOn August 16th\, 1819\, a mass rally of democrati
 c reformers gathered in St. Peter's Field in Manchester. The meeting's aim
 s were explicitly peaceful and legal\; organizers stated the protest's pur
 pose was "to consider the propriety of adopting the most LEGAL and EFFECTU
 AL means of obtaining a reform in the Common House of Parliament" and did 
 not allow participants to bear arms.\n\nDespite this\, members of the Brit
 ish Cavalry attempted to arrest leaders of the protest. When their horses 
 became stuck in the crowd\, officers panicked and began indiscriminately a
 ttacking the meeting's participants. Exact numbers are difficult to calcul
 ate\, but modern estimates are that 18 people were killed and approximatel
 y 600 more were injured.\n\nAmong those killed was a two year old boy\, kn
 ocked from his mother's arms by a charging horse. John Lees\, a working cl
 ass veteran of Waterloo who later died of wounds sustained at the Peterloo
  Massacre\, stated "At Waterloo there was man to man but there it was down
 right murder".\n\nThe British government supported the military's actions 
 and\, as a result of the disorder\, passed the "Six Acts"\, legislation to
  suppress radical meetings and publications. By the end of 1820\, every si
 gnificant working-class radical reformer was in jail.\n\nOn the political 
 situation after Peterloo\, historian Robert Reid wrote "it is not fanciful
  to compare the restricted freedoms of the British worker in the post-Pete
 rloo period in the early nineteenth century with those of the black South 
 African in the post-Sharpeville period of the late twentieth century."

DESCRIPTION:Marcus Garvey\, born on this day in 1887\, was a Jamaican poli
 tical activist\, author\, and orator who became one of the most influentia
 l black nationalist and Pan-Africanist leaders of the 20th century.\n\nGar
 vey was born to a moderately prosperous Afro-Jamaican family in Saint Ann'
 s Bay\, Jamaica\, and apprenticed into the print trade as a teenager. Work
 ing in Kingston\, he became involved in trade unionism before living brief
 ly in Costa Rica\, Panama\, and England.\n\nGreatly influenced by Booker T
 . Washington's autobiography "Up From Slavery"\, Garvey began to support e
 conomic separatism and social segregation. In 1914\, he founded the Univer
 sal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL
 \, commonly known as UNIA)\, through which he declared himself Provisional
  President of Africa. Ideologically a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist
 \, his ideas came to be known as "Garveyism".\n\nGarvey launched various b
 usinesses in the U.S.\, including the Negro Factories Corporation and Negr
 o World newspaper. In 1919\, he became President of the Black Star Line sh
 ipping and passenger company\, designed to forge a link between North Amer
 ica and Africa and facilitate African-American migration to Liberia.\n\nIn
  1923\, Garvey was convicted of mail fraud for selling the company's stock
  and imprisoned in the U.S. Penitentiary Atlanta for nearly two years. Gar
 vey blamed Jewish people for his sentence\, claiming that they were prejud
 iced against him because of his links to the Ku Klux Klan\, whom he had co
 llaborated with on the basis of their shared goal of racial separatism.\n\
 nGarvey's influence has been repeatedly emphasized by black intellectuals 
 - Kwame Nkrumah cited "The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey" as th
 e text that most inspired him\, American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates described
  Garvey as the "patron saint" of the black nationalist movement\, and scho
 lar Molefi Kete Asante included Garvey on his list of 100 Greatest African
  Americans.\n\nThose who dissented from this view include W.E.B. Du Bois\,
  who\, after hearing of Garvey's meeting with the KKK\, called him the gre
 atest enemy of the Negro race\, and radical labor organizer A. Philip Rand
 olph\, who stated that Garvey and Garveyism should be purged from American
  soil.\n\nGarvey spent his last years in Jamaica trying to revive his poli
 tical fortunes. He died in London\, England in 1940.\n\n"A people without 
 the knowledge of their past history\, origin and culture is like a tree wi
 thout roots."\n\n- Marcus Garvey

 le rose up against their oppressors. Rebels held whites hostage to make de
 mands\, but generally abhorred violence. The state declared martial law\, 
 killing hundreds of people and displaying their corpses as a warning to th
 e survivors.\n\nThe revolt took place in modern day Guyana\, then the Brit
 ish colony of Demerara-Essequibo. The colony's primary export was sugar\, 
 and enslaved black people drastically outnumbered other groups on the isla
 nd. The year of the uprising\, the population consisted of approximately 2
 \,500 whites\, 2\,500 freed black people\, and 77\,000 slaves.\n\nThe rebe
 llion was linked to the church of John Smith\, a British missionary. One o
 f the leaders of the uprising was Jack Gladstone\, a cooper on the plantat
 ion where the rebellion started and the son of Quamina\, a prominent membe
 r of Smith's church.\n\nUpon learning of his son's plans\, Quamina opposed
  the revolt\, urging the planners to initiate a strike instead\, and to no
 t use violence. Quamina also informed John Smith of the plans\, which Smit
 h declined to disclose to the authorities.\n\nOn August 18th\, 1823\, more
  than 10\,000 enslaved people rose up against their masters to demand bett
 er treatment. Rebels generally abhorred violence\, choosing instead to hol
 d whites hostage in their homes and stockades as leverage with which to ma
 ke their demands. Despite the large scale of the revolt\, some of the ensl
 aved stayed loyal to their masters and defended their plantations.\n\nThe 
 Governor immediately declared martial law\, and\, when a crowd of 2\,000 r
 ebels refused to disperse on order of a colonial militia\, soldiers fired 
 into the crowd\, killing hundreds of people. Within two days\, the rebelli
 on was suppressed.\n\nIn the weeks following the suppression of uprising\,
  the colonizers executed dozens of slaves\, displaying the dismembered hea
 ds of those killed as a means of intimidation.\n\nJack Gladstone was sold 
 and deported to St. Lucia\, while Quamina was hunted down and killed on Se
 ptember 23rd. John Smith was arrested for not informing the government of 
 the plans of rebellion and died in prison. Smith's death made him a martyr
  within the British abolitionist movement.\n\nUnder pressure from London\,
  the Demerara Court of Policy passed various reforms for slave labor in 18
 25\, institutionalizing working hours and some civil rights for the enslav
 ed.\n\nIn 1833\, the British government passed the Slavery Abolition Act\,
  beginning a process of gradual abolition throughout its colonies.

  English girl 'you don't want to come and work here\, love\, we won't be a
 ble to pay the sort of wages that'll keep you here' – while we had to wo
 rk there because we were trapped."\n\nThe strike was sparked by the dismis

 ant Patel\, Bharat Patel and Suresh Ruparelia\, walked out in solidarity.\
 n\nBy August 23rd\, six workers began picketing outside Grunwick offices. 
 Soon\, postal workers began to refuse crossing the picket line to deliver 
 mail\, and the size of the pickets began to grow as workers from other ind
 ustries joined the protest in solidarity. In this fashion\, the Grunwick D
 ispute became the first labor struggle where majority non-white strikers r
 eceived widespread support from the labor movement (similar\, previous dis
 putes did not enjoy solidarity from white workers and racist unions).\n\nM
 eanwhile\, Grunwick raised pay by 15% for non-striking workers on the cond
 ition that they would not join the union. In June and July of 1977\, worke
 rs from across London began trying to prevent scabs from showing up to wor
 k\, leading to violent conflicts with police and widespread media coverage
 .\n\nThe dispute was reported nightly on the national television\, often s
 howing violent clashes between strikers and the paramilitary Metropolitan 
 Police's Special Patrol Group. More than 500 people were arrested\, the mo
 st since the general strike of 1926.\n\nThe incumbent Labour government co
 mmissioned the "Scarman Inquiry"\, which recommended both union recognitio
 n and re-instatement of the workers\, but the employer\, backed by the rig
 ht-wing National Association For Freedom (NAFF) and the Conservative Party
 \, successfully rejected these recommendations.\n\nThe Trades Union Congre
 ss (TUC) subsequently withdrew their support\, and the workers' strike com
 mittee announced the end of the dispute in June 1978. The strike's defeat 
 was a major victory for the British right-wing\, which began to successful
 ly undermine the power of labor under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher\
 , who became Prime Minister in 1979.\n\nOn the strike\, one of its leaders
 \, Jayaben Desai\, stated: "The strike is not so much about pay\, it is a 
 strike about human dignity."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1968\, four Warsaw Pact countries - the Soviet 
 Union\, Poland\, Bulgaria\, and Hungary - invaded Czechoslovakia with ~200
 \,000 troops to stop the "Prague Spring"\, liberal reforms promoted by the
  government of Alexander Dubček. Romania and Albania declined to particip
 ate in the attack\, the latter of which left the Warsaw Pact a month later
 .\n\nThe invasion took place in the context of liberal reforms promoted by
  the communist government of Alexander Dubček\, known as the "Prague Spri
 ng". The reforms included a decentralization of administrative authority\,
  loosening of restrictions on the media\, speech and travel\, and the deci
 sion to split into two countries\, the Czech and Slovak Republics.\n\nThe 
 reforms were not received well by the Soviets\, who\, after failed negotia
 tions\, sent ~200\,000 Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country.
  137 civilians were killed and 500 seriously wounded during the occupation
 .\n\nDubček and the Chairman of the National Assembly Josef Smrkovsky wer
 e arrested and taken to Moscow. They were allowed to return after adopting
  the "Moscow Protocol"\, which effectively reversed the liberalization of 
 the Prague Spring.\n\nThe occupation was met with widespread\, mostly non-
 violent resistance. Civilians purposely gave wrong directions to invading 
 soldiers and painted over direction-giving signs. On January 19th\, 1969\,
  student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague to protest the renewed s
 uppression of free speech. On September 8th\, 1968\, Polish accountant Rys
 zard Siwiec immolated himself in Warsaw during a harvest festival in prote
 st of the invasion.\n\nThe invasion caused major fractures in communist mo
 vements worldwide\, both inside and outside the Soviet bloc. Several KGB/G
 RU defectors and spies such as Oleg Gordievsky\, Vasili Mitrokhin\, and Dm
 itri Polyakov cited the 1968 invasion as their motivation for cooperating 
 with the Western Intelligence agencies.\n\nInternationally\, the Communist
  Party of Greece (KKE) suffered a major split over the internal disputes o
 ver the Prague Spring\, while Albania left the Warsaw Pact following the i
 nvasion. The People's Republic of China strongly condemned the military ac
 tion\; on August 23rd\, 1968\, at the Beijing Romanian Embassy\, Chinese P
 remier Zhou Enlai denounced the Soviet Union for "fascist politics\, great
  power chauvinism\, national egoism\, and social imperialism".\n\nMeanwhil
 e\, the Portuguese Communist Party\, the South African Communist Party\, a
 nd the Communist Party USA all supported the Soviet position.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1948\, workers of the British-owned African Wha
 rfage Company (AWC) began a work stoppage that turned into a general strik
 e\, paralyzing the city for weeks and leading the government to declare a 
 state of emergency.\n\nPart of the power of this strike came from the fact
  that the AWC held a monopoly on cargo shipping in the port of Zanzibar Ci
 ty - when their workers struck\, supplies across the region were affected.
  One example of this is when\, on August 26th\, an Italian cruise liner ar
 rived in Zanzibar seeking water supplies\, but could not get it due to the
  dockworkers' strike.\n\nThe labor action did not begin as a general strik
 e. Abbas Othman\, an AWC worker and strike leader\, had attempted to invol
 ve other labor groups\, but they initially declined.\n\nAs food shortages 
 began to occur\, Zanzibar President Glenday ordered that all weapons were 
 to be delivered to the police station and banned all meetings not approved
  by the Chief of Police. A few days later\, he declared sweeping emergency
  powers that gave the government control over food and movement of people.
 \n\nDespite this repression\, the general strike succeeded\, both in the s
 hort term and the long. By December 1st\, 1948\, the AWC had increased all
  of their laborers' wage rates. Higher wages and better conditions were al
 so put in place for workers involved in the packing of produce for export\
 , the bakery trade\, the soap and oil factories\, government\, and coconut
  husking. A Port Labour Advisory Committee was also formed to advise the g
 overnment of labor conditions for port workers.

 6 black people\, and militias killed at least 100 more\, some of whom were
  not involved in the rebellion.\n\nTurner went on the run\, eluding captur

  to protect strikebreakers and evict strikers from company houses. The New
  York Times called the immigrant workforce "savages" and "illiterate forei
 gners".\n\nManagement refused to speak with the workers' representatives a
 nd James Rider\, manager of the Pressed Steel Car Company\, responded to t
 heir strike by hiring Pearl Bergoff\, a notorious owner of a strike-breaki
 ng paramilitary force.\n\nThe workers were joined by members of the Indust
 rial Workers of the World (IWW)\, including founders William Trautmann and
  "Big Bill" Haywood\, as well as "Smiling Joe" Ettor.\n\nThe walkout drew 
 national attention when\, on this day in 1909\, a bloody battle took place
  between strikers\, private security agents\, and the Pennsylvania State P
 olice. The violence began after strikers boarded a trolley to search for s
 cabs and they were confronted by an armed deputy\, who opened fire. In the
  fighting that followed\, between 12 and 26 people were killed.\n\nThe str
 ike was settled on September 8th when Pressed Steel Car agreed to a wage i
 ncrease\, the posting of wage rates\, and ended abuses in company housing 
 practices. This labor dispute would be a precursor to the Great Steel Stri
 ke of 1919.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1978\, the Sandinista National Liberation Front
  (FSLN) staged a massive kidnapping operation where they captured the Nati
 onal Palace and held more than 1\,000 people hostage in exchange for money
 \, the release of political prisoners\, and the ability to publicize their
  cause.\n\nIn the 1970s\, Nicaragua was rocked by political turmoil\, with
  widespread riots and multiple anti-government general strikes\, occurring
  in 1978. A revolutionary campaign to overthrow the government by the Sand
 inista National Liberation Front (FSLN) was also underway. Despite these e
 fforts\, the leader of Nicaragua\, Anastasio Somoza\, remained in power.\n
 \nOn August 22nd\, 1978\, with just 26 participants\, the FSLN staged a ma
 ssive kidnapping operation where they captured the National Palace.\n\nMan
 y of the rebels were quite young - Columbian socialist author Gabriel Garc
 ía Márquez wrote that\, excluding the experienced guerilla leader Éden 
 Pastora\, the average age of the group was twenty. Three were just eightee
 n years old.\n\nLed by Pastora\, the Sandinistan forces captured the Palac
 e while the legislature was in session\, taking more than 1\,000 hostages.
  The rebels demanded money\, the release of Sandinistan prisoners\, and\, 
 "a means of publicizing the Sandinista cause".\n\nAfter two days\, the gov
 ernment agreed to pay $500\,000 and release certain prisoners\, marking a 
 major victory for the FSLN. Somoza was finally ousted by the FSLN in 1979.

  Dutch artist and anti-fascist who\, after destroying a Nazi office\, was 
 executed in 1943\, stating as his last words "Tell the people that homosex

 ustrating poems and painting murals. He later became an author\, publishin
 g two novels with his own illustrations and a biography of the painter Mat
 thĳs Maris.\n\nArondeus was active in the anti-Nazi resistance\, helping 
 forge documents to protect persecuted groups. A major obstacle to the succ
 ess of this forgery was the Municipal Office for Population Registration\,
  an Amsterdam office that contained millions of identifying records for Je
 ws and others wanted by the Gestapo.\n\nArondeus and other members of the 
 resistance bombed the office on March 27th\, 1943\, subduing the guards vi
 a injection\, and succeeding in destroying approximately 800\,000 document
 s. Arondeus was arrested on April 1st.\n\nAlthough he refused to give up t
 he rest of his team\, his notebook was found and a majority of the group w
 as also arrested. On June 18th\, Arondeus and fourteen others were tried a
 nd sentenced to death. Ardoneus pleaded guilty and took the full blame\, w
 hich may have contributed to two members receiving clemency.\n\nBefore his
  execution\, Arondeus made a point of ensuring the public would be aware t
 hat he and two other men in the group were gay\, asking an acquaintance to
  "Tell the people that homosexuals can be brave!" Sometimes this quote is 
 also translated as "The people would know that gays are no cowards!" or "T

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1917\, 156 black U.S. soldiers mutinied\, march
 ing into Houston\, Texas\, shooting at civilians and battling with police\
 , causing 21 deaths. The riot took place in the context of severe police b
 rutality and racial discrimination.\n\nAround noon on August 23rd\, 1917\,
  Lee Sparks and Rufus Daniels\, two Houston police officers\, disrupted a 
 street gathering in Houston's predominantly-black San Felipe district by f
 iring warning shots and then dragged and beat a woman dressed in her night
 gown from her home.\n\nThey were then approached by Private Alonzo Edwards
 \, who offered to take the woman into custody\, however the police pistol-
 whipped and arrested him. When Corporal Charles Baltimore later asked the 
 officers about the condition of Edwards\, he was also pistol-whipped\, sho
 t at while fleeing\, and then captured and beaten.\n\nWhen rumors of the b
 rutality made it back to Camp Logan\, 156 soldiers of the Third Battalion 
 of the all-black Twenty-fourth U.S. Infantry Regiment mutinied and took up
  arms and marched into Houston\, Texas. Police\, thinking the black men co
 uldn't arm themselves\, only sent six officers out to meet the group\, two
  of whom were killed immediately.\n\nBy the time the firing ceased\, 17 pe
 ople were dead: four police officers\, nine civilians\, and two soldiers. 
 The next morning\, Houston was placed under martial law. The remaining sol
 diers in the Twenty-fourth's camp were disarmed\, and a house-to-house sea
 rch uncovered a number of soldiers hiding within the San Felipe district. 
 Soldiers in local jails were turned over to the Army\, and the Third Batta
 lion was sent by rail back to New Mexico.\n\nThe soldiers were tried at th
 ree courts-martial for mutiny. 19 were executed and 63 were sentenced to l
 ife imprisonment. Two white officers faced court-martial\, but they were r
 eleased. No white civilians were brought to trial.\n\nIn 1991\, historian 
 Calvin C. Smith noted that many of the sentenced were not conclusively ide
 ntified as having even participated in the riot\, despite repeated pledges
  of fair trials and absolute transparency from various political officials
 \, including white supremacist U.S. President Woodrow Wilson.

  to subside\, anti-immigrant sentiment increased.\n\nEyewitness accounts o
 n the exact trigger of the violence differ\, but nearly all cite a West In

 g man was assaulted\, and soon a crowd of over 1\,000 had gathered in the 
 area.\n\nThe racial violence lasted for many hours\, with white attackers 
 being identified as "Teddy Boys". Eight people were taken to the hospital\
 , with one man requiring 37 stitches following a wound to the throat.\n\nD
 espite the racial character of the violence\, government officials downpla

 elstan Popkess dismissed claims that the rioting was caused by prejudice a
 t the time\, and a 1989 report from the Nottingham Constabulary blamed the

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1927\, Italian immigrant anarchists Nicola Sacc
 o and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were executed by the U.S. government after they 
 were dubiously convicted of murder\, leading to international episodes of 
 protest and violence.\n\nSacco\, born in 1891\, was a shoemaker and a nigh
 t watchman\, who migrated to the United States at the age of seventeen. Va
 nzetti was a fishmonger born on June 11th\, 1888. Two men met at a strike 
 in 1917.\n\nAfter a deadly shoe store robbery in 1919\, both Sacco and Van
 zetti were arrested. When searched by police\, both denied owning any guns
 \, but were found to be holding loaded pistols. Sacco was found to have an
  Italian passport\, anarchist literature\, and a loaded .32 Colt Model 190
 3 automatic pistol. Vanzetti had four 12-gauge shotgun shells and a five-s
 hot nickel-plated .38-caliber Harrington & Richardson revolver. Despite th
 is\, both Sacco and Vanzetti had solid alibis for where they were during t
 he murder.\n\nAnti-Italian and anti-anarchist sentiments played a signific
 ant role in their trial. Presiding Judge Thayer was an avowed enemy of ana
 rchists. When giving his final statement in 1927\, Vanzetti said "I am suf
 fering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical\; I have suffered 
 because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute 
 me two times\, and if I could be reborn two other times\, I would live aga
 in to do what I have done already."\n\nSacco and Vanzetti's arrest\, trial
 \, conviction\, and execution became an international incident that caused
  an outrage among people of all political persuasions\, not just anarchist
 s. Among their advocates were Harvard law professor and future Supreme Cou
 rt Justice Felix Frankfurter\, who wrote that Judge Thayer's statement was
  "a farrago of misquotations\, misrepresentations\, suppressions\, and mut
 ilations"\,\n\nDespite international advocacy on their behalf\, including 
 rallies\, sympathy strikes\, and pleas for a re-trial\, Sacco and Vanzetti
 's death sentences were not commuted. Vanzetti\, in his final moments\, sh
 ook hands with guards and thanked them for their kind treatment\, read a s
 tatement proclaiming his innocence\, and finally said\, "I wish to forgive
  some people for what they are now doing to me." Sacco was next and walked
  quietly to the electric chair\, then shouted "Farewell\, mother."\n\nFoll
 owing their execution\, some radicals\, including Italian anarchist Severi
 no Di Giovanni\, began a series of bombing campaigns\, targeting Judge Tha
 yer\, a juror involved in the trial\, Wall Street banks\, and the American
  Embassy in Buenos Aires.\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of the executions\, M
 assachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis issued a proclamation that Sacco and
  Vanzetti had been unfairly tried and convicted and that "any disgrace sho
 uld be forever removed from their names".

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1970\, the largest U.S. farm worker strike in h

 anized with César Chávez and the United Farm Workers (UFW)\, struck\, do
 ubling the price of lettuce and costing sellers $500\,000 a day.\n\nThe UF
 W had just won the Delano Grape Strike\, which had lasted an astonishing f
 ive years\, winning contracts with dozens of grape growers that were the f
 irst of their kind in agricultural history.\n\nThe origins of the Salad Bo
 wl Strike lay in a jurisdictional dispute with the International Brotherho
 od of Teamsters\, which had won the right to organize field workers after 
 concluding a successful strike of drivers and packers in the lettuce produ
 cing sector in July.\n\nThe UFW strongly contested this claim\, and\, afte
 r negotiations broke down\, between 5\,000-7\,000 field workers went on st
 rike. The labor action was not just a strike\, but also included mass pick
 ets\, boycotts\, and secondary boycotts by the participants.\n\nThe price 
 of lettuce almost doubled immediately\, and the interruption to work cost 
 lettuce growers approximately $500\,000 a day. The strike was a bitter dis
 pute which suffered violence and state repression. César Chávez\, a lead
 ing labor organizer\, was jailed after refusing to stop the picketing on c
 ourt order. On November 4th\, 1970 a UFW regional office was bombed.\n\nTh
 e strike ended on March 26th\, 1971 when the Teamsters and UFW signed a ne
 w jurisdictional agreement reaffirming the UFW's right to organize field w
 orkers\, however jurisdictional disputes between the UFW and Teamsters con
 tinued for years afterward. In 1975\, the California Agricultural Labor Re
 lations Act (CALRA) became law\, establishing the right to collective barg
 aining for farmworkers in that state\, a first in U.S. history.

  Zinn in 1949 due to his participation in organized labor. In the 1960s\, 
 as a result of Zinn's campaigning against the Vietnam War and his influenc

 to the country by adding him to the Security Index\, a list of American ci
 tizens who could be summarily arrested if a state of emergency was declare
 d.\n\nFBI memos\, released in 2010 after a Freedom of Information Act (FOI
 A) request\, also show that they were concerned with Zinn's repeated criti
 cism of the FBI for failing to protect black people against white mob viol
 ence. Zinn's daughter said she was not surprised by the files - "He always
  knew they had a file on him."\n\nZinn described himself as "something of 
 an anarchist\, something of a socialist. Maybe a democratic socialist." He
  wrote extensively about the Civil Rights Movement\, the anti-war movement
  and labor history of the United States. His memoir\, "You Can't Be Neutra

DESCRIPTION:John Maclean\, born on this day in 1879\, was a revolutionary

 .\n\nMaclean's revolutionary politics were well-known\, and in 1915\, he w

  primary school teacher. As a consequence\, he became a full-time Marxist 
 lecturer and organizer\, educating other Glaswegian workers in Marxist the

 \, and\, in 1918\, he was arrested for sedition. During the trial\, Maclea
 n gave the now legendary "speech from the dock"\, expounding on his positi
 on. He was sentenced to five years' penal servitude\, but was released aft
 er the November armistice.\n\nMaclean supported Irish independence on an a
 nti-imperialist basis\, describing the Irish War of Independence as "The I
 rish fight for freedom" and even condoning the assassination of a magistra
 te\, Alan Bell.\n\nMaclean saw the war in Ireland as strengthening the Bol
 shevik revolution in Russia\, arguing that "Irish Sinn Féiners\, who make
  no profession of socialism or communism...are doing more to help Russia a
 nd the revolution than all we professed Marxian Bolsheviks in Britain".\n\
 nIn captivity\, Maclean had been on hunger strike\, and prolonged force-fe

 ide\; it was previously a bar for only gay men.\n\nOn the early morning ho
 urs of June 28th\, 1969\, the Stonewall uprising occurred. While the first
  two nights of rioting were the most intense\, the clashes with police wou
 ld result in a series of spontaneous demonstrations and marches through th
 e gay neighborhoods of Greenwich Village for roughly a week afterwards.\n\
 nAccording to the New-York Historical Society\, "While there are many conf
 licting stories about the uprising’s start\, it is clear that Marsha was
  on the front lines. In one account\, she started the uprising by throwing
  a shot glass at a mirror. In another\, she climbed a lamppost and dropped
  a heavy purse onto a police car\, shattering the windshield." After Stone
 wall\, Johnson became more involved in activism\, helping found the Gay Li
 beration Front.\n\nTo help provide a home for vulnerable trans youth\, Mar
 sha and her friend Sylvia Rivera together formed the Street Transvestite A
 ctivist Revolutionaries (STAR). The first STAR House was in the back of a 
 seemingly abandoned truck in Greenwich Village\, housing nearly 24 people.
 \n\nOne morning\, they returned to the truck just as its driver was pullin
 g away with STAR residents sleeping inside\, who were then forced to jump 
 from a moving vehicle. Marsha and Sylvia then rented and fixed up a dilapi
 dated building to house STAR residents for eight months before being evict
 ed.\n\nShortly after a pride parade in 1992\, Johnson's body was discovere
 d floating in the Hudson River. Police ruled the death a suicide\, but Joh
 nson's friends and other members of the local community insisted Johnson w
 as not suicidal and noted that the back of Johnson's head had a massive wo
 und.\n\nJohnson was cremated and\, following a funeral at a local church\,
  friends released her ashes over the river.\n\nThe 2012 documentary "Pay I
 t No Mind – The Life and Times of Marsha P. Johnson" heavily features se
 gments from a 1992 interview with Johnson\, filmed shortly before her deat
 h.\n\n"Darling\, I want my gay rights now"\n\n- Marsha P. Johnson

  uprising in U.S. history.
DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1921\, the first skirmishes of the Battle of Bl
 air Mountain took place. Involving more than 10\,000 armed workers battlin
 g with state and strikebreaking forces\, it was the largest post-Civil War
  uprising and the largest labor uprising in U.S. history.\n\nThe conflict 
 occurred in Logan County\, West Virginia as part of the "Coal Wars"\, a se
 ries of early 20th-century labor disputes in Appalachia.\n\nFor five days\
 , from late August to early September 1921\, some 10\,000 armed coal miner
 s confronted 3\,000 lawmen and strikebreakers who were backed by coal mine
  operators during the miners' attempt to unionize the southwestern West Vi
 rginia coalfields.\n\nSometimes the Battle's anniversary is marked as Augu
 st 31st\, when the miners' army clashed with armed forces marshaled by the
  county sheriff\, coal companies\, and state police in Logan County.\n\nTh
 e battle ended on September 4th after approximately one million rounds had
  been fired\, aerial bombardment of the miners\, and the U.S. Army's inter
 vention\, acting on orders from President Harding.\n\nUp to 100 people wer
 e killed throughout the uprising. 985 miners were indicted for murder\, co
 nspiracy to commit murder\, accessory to murder\, and treason against the 
 state of West Virginia. Though some were acquitted by sympathetic juries\,
  others were imprisoned for several years.\n\nAccording to the Cultural La
 ndscape Foundation\, there has never been a complete archaeological survey
  of the battlefield. The West Virginia Mine Wars Museum is raising funds t
 o sponsor a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) scan of the Nomination Are
 a in order to identify the major zones of historical significance and prom
 ote the site's value as a historical park.

COMMENT:On this day in 1968\, black bus drivers of the Chicago Transit Aut

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1968\, black bus drivers in Chicago turned off 
 the lights on their vehicles and headed back to the Chicago Transit Author
 ity (CTA) bus barns\, beginning a two-week strike that shut down 52 of the
  city's 128 bus routes and effectively paralyzed the south and west sides 
 of the city. More than half of the CTA's bus drivers were African-American
  and for weeks they had been fighting unfair union representation.\n\nLike
  many other protest movements in the 50s and 60s\, the drivers took as the
 ir model the Montgomery bus boycott\, organizing car pools and CTW "courte
 sy cars" to meet the transportation shortfall in some neighborhoods.\n\nAc
 cording to Standish Willis\, one of the striking drivers who later wrote a
  college thesis on the incident: "Black drivers were being arrested while 
 trying to close down the white stations\, and we were losing what little m
 oney we had bailing them out of jail...White drivers at black stations res
 pected the picket lines. The white drivers at the white ones did not."\n\n
 According to Willis\, the strike's failure was due to the collective effor
 t of establishment political powers working against the strike: "With the 
 police arresting our guys\, the judges putting guys in jail and holding th
 em for contempt\, and the union threatening to kick our leaders out\, it w
 as a pretty concerted attack. And we certainly didn't have enough money to
  get people out of jail at the rate they were putting them in."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1913\, the Dublin Lock-Out began as hundreds of
  tram workers went out on strike\, growing into one of most significant in
 dustrial disputes in Irish history. It involved ~20\,000 workers and 300 c
 olluding employers\, and led to the founding of the Irish Citizen Army (IC
 A) to protect worker demonstrations.\n\nIn the years leading up to the str
 ike\, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU) had been seek
 ing to unionize and radicalize the Irish workforce. Founded by socialist r
 evolutionary James Larkin in 1908\, the ITGWU was one of the first Irish u
 nions that catered to both skilled and unskilled workers.\n\nIn July 1913\
 , three hundred businesses (led by capitalist William Martin Murphy) agree
 d to not allow the ITGWU to unionize the Dublin workforce. Murphy dismisse
 d hundreds of workers of suspected of union membership soon after.\n\nMany
  employers in Dublin then locked out their own employees\, affecting tens 
 of thousands of Irish workers\, many of whom were already the poorest in t
 he United Kingdom.\n\nAfter outbreaks of violence between striking workers
  and strike-breakers occurred\, James Connolly\, Larkin and ex-British Arm
 y Captain Jack White formed a worker's militia\, the Irish Citizen Army\, 
 to protect workers' demonstrations.\n\nThe lock-out concluded in early 191
 4\, when the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in Britain rejected Larkin and Co
 nnolly's request for a sympathetic strike. Most workers\, many of whom wer
 e on the brink of starvation\, went back to work and signed pledges not to
  join the ITGWU\, which was further weakened when Larkin fled to the Unite
 d States and James Connolly was executed following the 1916 Easter Rising.
 \n\nMany of the blacklisted workers joined the British Army\, having no ot
 her source of pay to support their families\, and quickly found themselves
  in the trenches of World War I. ITGWU eventually recovered and gained str
 ength after WWI\; by 1920 the ITGWU was Ireland's largest union with 120\,
 000 members\, compared with its pre-war peak of 24\,135 at the start of Ja

 paper as "a 17-minute melee". Footage was broadcast internationally\, more
  than 600 were arrested.
DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1968\, six days of continuous protests at the C
 hicago Democratic National Convention climaxed in a police riot characteri
 zed by the Chicago Sun-Times as "a 17-minute melee in front of the Conrad 
 Hilton". Footage of the violence\, as well as disruptions on the conventio
 n floor\, was broadcast internationally\, and more than 600 people were ar
 rested.\n\nIn 1967\, counterculture and anti-Vietnam War protest groups ha
 d been promising to come to Chicago and disrupt the Democratic Nation Conv
 ention (DNC)\, while the city was promising to maintain law and order.\n\n
 For eight days\, the protesters were met by the Chicago Police Department 
 (CPD) in the streets and parks of Chicago while the Democrats held the con
 vention in the International Amphitheater. The protests climaxed in what a
  major report later called a "police riot" on August 28th\, 1968.\n\nIn de
 fiance of explicit orders by the police\, thousands of protesters attempte
 d to march on the streets of Chicago. When they did so\, they were "attack
 ed blitzkrieg fashion by busloads of club-swinging cops" and beaten and ar
 rested en masse. According to the New York Times\, "onlookers joined the p
 rotesters in booing the police. Rolls of toilet paper\, bars of soap\, and
  water glasses were thrown at the police from [Hilton] hotel windows\, alo
 ng with a number of rocks\, bottles and cherry bombs".\n\nMore than 600 pe
 ople were arrested\, and more than 100 protesters and cops were treated wi
 th injuries that night. So much tear gas was thrown that it could smelled 
 from the hotel suite of Hubert Humphrey\, who went on to win the president
 ial nomination that night.\n\nOn the convention floor\, several delegates 
 made statements against Mayor Daley and the CPD\, like Senator Abraham Rib
 icoff who denounced the use of "Gestapo tactics on the streets of Chicago"
  in his speech nominating George McGovern. Subsequently\, the "Walker Repo
 rt to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence" as
 signed blame for the violence on the police force\, calling the incident a
  "police riot".

DESCRIPTION:Emmett Till was a black child tortured and lynched by white su
 premacists in Mississippi on this day in 1955\, at 14 years old. His kille
 rs sold the story of how they murdered him for $4\,000 after being acquitt
 ed by an all-white jury.\n\nEmmett was born in Chicago to Mamie Carthan\, 
 a working class woman from Tallahatchie County\, Mississippi\, where the a
 verage annual income for a black family was $462 (equivalent to $4\,700 in
  2016 dollars). In 1955\, Till's great-uncle visited the family in Chicago
  and told Emmett stories about the Mississippi Delta\, leading Emmett to p
 lan a visit.\n\nTill arrived in Money\, Mississippi\, on August 21st\, 195
 5. On the 24th\, Till and his friends visited a store owned by a white cou
 ple. Till was accused of whistling at and approaching the wife\, Carolyn B
 ryant\, while at the store.\n\nFacts of Till's interaction with Bryant are
  disputed\, however many of the accusations - that Till put his hands on B
 ryant\, that he made lewd comments at her\, or that he bragged to his frie
 nds about having had sex with a white woman - have been withdrawn by the p
 eople who initially made them. Till's mother has also stated that she taug
 ht Emmett to whistle to help with his stutter\, which he developed after a
  bout with polio.\n\nAfter word broke out that an interaction had taken pl
 ace between Till and Bryant\, Carolyn's husband\, Roy Bryant\, and his hal
 f-brother\, J.W. Milam abducted Emmett\, tortured him\, shot him\, and thr
 ew his corpse into the Tallahatchie River. Following Till's disappearance\
 , civil rights activists Medgar Evers and Amzie Moore went undercover as c
 otton pickers to try and locate him.\n\nThree days after his abduction and
  murder\, Till's swollen and disfigured body was found by two boys who wer
 e fishing in the Tallahatchie River. His head was very badly mutilated\, h
 e had been shot above the right ear\, an eye was dislodged from the socket
 \, there was evidence that he had been beaten on the back and the hips\, a
 nd his body weighted by a fan blade\, which was fastened around his neck w
 ith barbed wire.\n\nMamie decided to have an open-casket funeral\, saying:
  "There was just no way I could describe what was in that box. No way. And
  I just wanted the world to see." Tens of thousands of people lined the st
 reet outside the mortuary to view Till's body\, and days later thousands m
 ore attended his funeral at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ.\n\nIn 
 the lead-up to Bryant and Milam's trial\, local newspapers falsely reporte
 d that there were riots at Till's funeral\, and depicted both men smiling 
 in military uniforms. On September 23rd\, 1955\, an all-white\, all-male j
 ury (both women and blacks had been explicitly banned) acquitted Bryant an
 d Milam after a 67-minute deliberation. One juror said "If we hadn't stopp
 ed to drink pop\, it wouldn't have taken that long."\n\nProtected against 
 double jeopardy\, Bryant and Milam quickly struck a deal with "Look" magaz
 ine in 1956 to tell their story for approximately $4\,000 ($35\,000 in 201
 6 dollars).\n\nEmmett Till's murder became a flashpoint in the American ci
 vil rights movement\; the Montgomery Bus Boycott began in December later t
 hat year after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white person. 
 Parks stated "I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back."\n\nMy
 rlie Evers\, the widow of Medgar Evers\, said in 1985 that Till's case res
 onated so strongly because it "shook the foundations of Mississippi—both
  black and white\, because ... with the white community ... it had become 
 nationally publicized ... with us as blacks ... it said\, even a child was
  not safe from racism and bigotry and death."

DESCRIPTION:Karl Heinrich Ulrichs\, born on this day in 1825\, was a Germa
 n lawyer\, journalist\, political activist\, and pioneering sexologist who
  scandalously came out publicly as gay in mid-19th century Germany.\n\nIn 
 1857\, Ulrichs was fired from his job as an administrative lawyer for the 
 district court of Hildesheim when his homosexuality was discovered. A few 
 years later\, he began publishing under his real name (sometimes cited as 
 the first public "coming out" in modern Western society) and wrote a state
 ment of legal and moral support for a man arrested for homosexual offenses
 .\n\nOn August 29th\, 1867 Ulrichs became the first homosexual to speak ou
 t publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of 
 German Jurists in Munich for a resolution urging the repeal of anti-homose
 xual laws. Although he was shouted down and no reform was passed\, two yea
 rs later the Austrian writer Karl-Maria Kertbeny coined the word "homosexu
 al"\, and from the 1870s the subject of sexual orientation in the modern s
 ense began to be widely discussed.\n\nIn Ulrichs' memory\, the Internation
 al Lesbian and Gay Law Association presents a Karl Heinrich Ulrichs Award 
 for distinguished contributions to the advancement of sexual equality.\n\n
 "Until my dying day I will look back with pride that I found the courage t
 o come face to face in battle against the spectre which for time immemoria
 l has been injecting poison into me and into men of my nature. Many have b
 een driven to suicide because all their happiness in life was tainted. Ind
 eed\, I am proud that I found the courage to deal the initial blow to the 
 hydra of public contempt."\n\n- Karl Ulrichs

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1830\, the Swing Riots began\, a widespread upr
 ising initiated by English agricultural workers in protest of harsh workin
 g conditions and mechanization that was decreasing the number and quality 
 of available jobs.\n\nThe riots began with the destruction of threshing ma
 chines in the Elham Valley area of East Kent in the summer of 1830\, and b
 y early December had spread through the whole of southern England and East
  Anglia\, also destroying workhouses\, tithe barns\, ricks (hay bales)\, a
 nd maiming cows.\n\nHistorian J. F. C. Harrison concluded that the riots w
 ere overwhelmingly the result of the progressive impoverishment and dispos
 session of the English agricultural workforce over the previous fifty year
 s.\n\nThe name "Swing Riots" was derived from the pseudonym "Captain Swing
 "\, often signed to the threatening letters sent to farmers\, magistrates\
 , parsons\, and others. The term "swing" was apparently a reference to the
  swinging stick of the flail used in hand threshing\, and Captain Swing wa
 s regarded as the mythical figurehead of the rebellion.\n\nThe Swing Riots
  were a major influence on the Whig Government and\, as a part of a wider 
 chain of social unrest\, helped pressure the government to pass the Reform
  Act 1832\, the "Poor Law Amendment Act" of 1834\, which ended "outdoor re
 lief" in cash or kind\, and the setting up of a chain of workhouses coveri
 ng larger areas across the country\, to which the poor had to go if they w
 anted help.

  Baron\, a British-Jamaican veteran\, drove off a lynch mob with guns and 
 molotov cocktails during the Notting Hill Race Riots.\n\nThe Notting Hill 
 race riots were a series of racially motivated riots that took place in No
 tting Hill\, England between August 23rd and September 5th\, 1958.\n\nAlth
 ough the racial uprising was initially sporadic\, one of the primary trigg
 ers is often thought to be an assault against Majbritt Morrison\, a white 
 Swedish woman who came to the attention of local white supremacists while 
 arguing with her Jamaican husband\, Raymond Morrison.\n\nFollowing this in
 cident\, a white mob several hundred strong formed (associated with the ra
 cist "Teddy Boys" movement) and began to terrorize people of color in the 
 area.\n\nOne resident\, Baker Baron\, born in Jamaica and a veteran of the
  Royal Air Force (RAF)\, decided to organize violent resistance to the mob
  violence. On this day in 1958\, his force drove off a lynch mob with molo
 tov cocktails. Here is what happened in Baron's own words:\n\n"When they t
 old us that they were coming to attack that night I went around and told a
 ll the people that was living in the area to withdraw that night. The wome
 n I told them to keep pots\, kettles of hot water boiling\, get some caust
 ic soda and if anyone tried to break down the door and come in\, to just l
 ash out with them.\n\nThe men\, well we were armed...Make no mistake\, the
 re were iron bars\, there were machetes\, there were all kinds of arms\, w
 eapons\, we had guns. We made preparations at the headquarters for the att
 ack. We had men on the housetop waiting for them...'Let's burn the niggers
 \, let's lynch the niggers.' That's the time I gave the order for the gate
 s to open...I says\, 'Start bombing them.' When they saw the Molotov cockt
 ails coming and they start to panic and run.\n\n...I knew one thing\, the 
 following morning we walked the streets free because they knew we were not
  going to stand for that type of behaviour."

 a prison-wide revolt emerged when a group of prisoners assembled\, demandi

 n had been assaulted\, the group staged a passive sit-in and blocked a pri
 son officer from locking a door.\n\nThe protest escalated into destruction
  of prison property and outright rebellion. By the next day\, inmates had 
 control of two-thirds of the jail. Over the next four days\, they caused 
 £4m worth of damage.\n\nThe rebelling prisoners made three demands: one\,
  that the deputy regional director of prisons and chairman of the board of
  visitors and his deputy would be present at the surrender\; two\, that Ir
 ish prisoners would not be singled out for special treatment\, they would 
 all be treated the same as other prisoners\; three\, that prisoners wanted
  to be received by their own officers from Hull.\n\nThese demands\, along 
 with a promise to end brutality from guards\, led to the prisoners' peacef
 ul surrender on September 3rd. Upon re-entering the prison\, however\, man
 y of the prisoners were severely beaten. Hull prison itself remained close
 d for a year\, so extensive was the damage done to it.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1920\, the first of many worker occupations and
  seizures of factories in Italy began\, a movement that more than half a m
 illion workers participated in.\n\nDuring the month of September 1920\, a 
 widespread occupation of Italian factories by their workers took place. Al
 though originating in the auto factories\, steel mills\, and machine tool 
 plants of the metal sector\, the occupation/revolt spread to cotton mills 
 and hosiery firms\, lignite mines\, tire factories\, breweries and distill
 eries\, and steamships and warehouses in port towns. At its height\, more 
 than 600\,000 workers were involved.\n\nThe worker rebellion was the culmi
 nation of years of labor strife - weeks before the occupations\, the Itali
 an Federation of Metallurgical Workers (FIOM)\, the Italian Socialist Part
 y (PSI)\, and the General Confederation of Labor (CGL) called for "obstruc
 tionism" (essentially\, a work slowdown) to be applied in all the engineer
 ing factories and shipyards starting on August 21st.\n\nBy the 24th\, prod
 uction at the Romeo factory in Milan had come to a complete standstill. A 
 week later\, production at the FIAT-Centro plant was reduced by 60%. On th
 e morning of the 30th\, the 2000 workers of the Romeo plant found the gate
 s locked and the factory surrounded by troops. The FIOM responded by calli
 ng on its members to occupy the 300 engineering factories in Milan. Histor
 ian Lynn Williams describes what happened next:\n\n"Between the 1st and 4t
 h of September metal workers occupied factories throughout the Italian pen
 insula...the occupations rolled forward not only in the industrial heartla
 nd around Milan\, Turin and Genoa but in Rome\, Florence\, Naples and Pale
 rmo\, in a forest of red and black flags and a fanfare of workers bands...
 Within three days 400\,000 workers were in occupation. As the movement spr
 ead to other sectors\, the total rose to over half a million."\n\nAlthough
  some radical elements within the workers' movement (Antonio Gramsci\, the
  Italian Syndicalist Union) called for revolution\, referring to the occup
 ations as "an expropriating general strike" and demanding total socializat
 ion of the economy\, more moderate forces (the CGL) prevailed\, using the 
 pressure of the rebellion to cut a deal with employers\, granting better c
 onditions to the workers on the condition of returning to work.

  for Henry Morton Stanley and the African International Association\, a fr
 ont for King Leopold II of Belgium in his colonization of the Congo.\n\nIn
  1890\, Casement met Joseph Conrad\, who had come to the Congo to pilot a 
 merchant ship. According to author Liesl Schillinger\, both were inspired 
 by the idea that "European colonisation would bring moral and social progr
 ess to the continent and free its inhabitants 'from slavery\, paganism and
  other barbarities.' Each would soon learn the gravity of his error."\n\nI
 n 1904\, he published the "Casement Report"\, which\, via direct interview
 s with workers\, overseers\, and mercenaries\, exposed the enslavement\, m
 utilation\, and torture of natives on the rubber plantations. The report c
 aused an international scandal and led to various reform organizations in 
 the West.\n\nA few years later\, Casement traveled to the Putumayo Distric
 t in South America\, where the rubber was harvested deep in the Amazon Bas
 in\, and exposed the treatment of indigenous people in Peru. Finding condi
 tions just as inhumane as what he witnessed in the Congo\, Casement interv
 iewed both the Putumayo and men who had abused them\, publishing his findi
 ngs in a first-person narrative that again caused an international scandal
 .\n\nIn November\, 1914 Casement helped form the Irish Volunteers. He trav
 eled to both the United States and Germany to promote the Irish nationalis
 t cause and acquire aid for it.\n\nIn 1916\, he was captured by the Britis
 h government and charged with high treason. During trial proceedings\, the
  government secretly circulated alleged excerpts from Casement's journals\
 , exposing him as a homosexual. The authenticity of these documents is sti
 ll debated today.\n\nCasement was hanged at Pentonville Prison on August 3
 rd\, 1916 at 51 years old.\n\n"Self government is our right\, a thing born
  to us at birth a thing no more to be doled out to us by another people th
 en the right to life itself then the right to feel the sun or smell the fl
 owers or to love our kind."\n\n- Roger Casement

DESCRIPTION:Walter Reuther\, born on this day in 1907\, was an American le
 ader of organized labor and civil rights activist who helped build the Uni
 ted Automobile Workers (UAW) into a politically progressive labor union.\n
 \nReuther saw labor movements not as narrow special interest groups but as
  instruments to advance the causes of social justice and human rights.\n\n
 Reuther leveraged the UAW's resources and influence to advocate for worker
 s' rights\, civil rights\, women's rights\, universal health care\, public
  education\, affordable housing\, environmental stewardship and nuclear no
 nproliferation around the world. Reuther survived two attempted assassinat
 ions\, including one at home where he was struck by a 12-gauge shotgun bla
 st fired through his kitchen window.\n\nReuther was an ally of MLK Jr. and
  César Chavez\, marching with the former on several occasions. A lifetime
  environmentalist\, Reuther also played a critical role in funding and org
 anizing the first Earth Day on April 22nd\, 1970.\n\nDespite Reuther's adv
 ocacy for social justice\, he did not seek systemic change. Socialist auto
 worker Beatrice Hansen had this to say of Reuther in 1955:\n\n"Yes\, Reuth
 er\, like the capitalists\, is satisfied to live with things substantially
  as they are\, instead of fighting to change things fundamentally\, the wa
 y [Eugene V. ] Debs did. Reuther shrugged his shoulders after the Ford set
 tlement and said\, 'You never get everything.'\n\nWhat a far cry that is f
 rom Eugene Debs\, whose mission it was to educate the workers so that they
  would not stop fighting and would not be satisfied until they had succeed
 ed in forever wiping the system of wage exploitation from the face of the 
 earth!"\n\nReuther died in plane crash on May 9th\, 1970\, and when an ins
 pection revealed that parts of the plane were installed incorrectly\, some
  speculated he had been assassinated. Public intellectual Michael Parenti 
 wrote "Reuther's demise appears as part of a truncation of liberal and rad
 ical leadership that included the deaths of four national figures: Preside
 nt John Kennedy\, Malcolm X\, Martin Luther King\, and Senator Robert Kenn
 edy."\n\n"There is no greater calling than to serve your fellow man. There
  is no greater contribution than to help the weak. There is no greater sat
 isfaction than to have done it well."\n\n- Walter Reuther

DESCRIPTION:Henry George\, born on this day in 1839\, was an American poli
 tical economist and journalist known for his widely influential text "Prog

 d Value Tax.\n\nGeorge also inspired the economic philosophy known as "Geo
 rgism"\, based on the belief that\, although people should own the value t
 hey produce themselves\, economic value derived from land and other natura
 l resources should belong equally to all members of society.\n\nGeorge and
  Karl Marx were aware of each other and feuded over conflicting ideas abou
 t the nature of capitalism. Marx called Georgism "capitalism's last ditch"
  and wrote "theoretically [Henry George] is utterly backward!…His fundam
 ental dogma is that everything would be all right if ground rent were paid
  to the state."\n\nGeorge's writing was immensely popular in 19th century 
 America. His most famous work\, "Progress and Poverty" (1879)\, sold milli
 ons of copies worldwide\, possibly more than any other American book befor
 e that time.\n\nThe text investigates the paradox of increasing inequality
  and poverty amid economic and technological progress\, the cyclic nature 
 of industrialized economies\, and the use of rent capture such as land val
 ue tax and other anti-monopoly reforms as a remedy for these and other soc
 ial problems.\n\n"The great cause of inequality in the distribution of wea
 lth is inequality in the ownership of land. The ownership of land is the g
 reat fundamental fact which ultimately determines the social\, the politic
 al\, and consequently the intellectual and moral condition of a people."\n

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1945\, Hồ Chí Minh announced the Proclamatio
 n of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to a crowd of thou
 sands at the Ba Đình flower garden (now Ba Đình Square).\n\nThe Procla
 mation led directly to war with France\, which concluded in the country be
 ing divided between French and self-rule at the 17th parallel. Vietnam wou
 ld not achieve a unified\, independent rule until 1976.\n\nThe Proclamatio
 n quoted heavily from the American Declaration of Independence and was veh
 emently critical of French rule. An excerpt reads:\n\n"'All men are create
 d equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights
 \, among them are Life\, Liberty\, and the pursuit of Happiness.' This imm
 ortal statement was made in the Declaration of Independence of the United 
 States of America in 1776. In a broader sense\, this means: All the people
 s on the earth are equal from birth\, all the peoples have a right to live
 \, to be happy and free.\n\n...Nevertheless\, for more than eighty years\,
  the French imperialists\, abusing the standard of Liberty\, Equality\, an
 d Fraternity\, have violated our Fatherland and oppressed our fellow-citiz
 ens. They have acted contrary to the ideals of humanity and justice. In th
 e field of politics\, they have deprived our people of every democratic li
 berty...They have built more prisons than schools. They have mercilessly s
 lain our patriots\; they have drowned our uprisings in rivers of blood...T
 hey have robbed us of our rice fields\, our mines\, our forests\, and our 
 raw materials.\n\nFor these reasons\, we\, members of the Provisional Gove
 rnment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam\, solemnly declare to the wor
 ld that Vietnam has the right to be a free and independent country - and i
 n fact is so already. The entire Vietnamese people are determined to mobil
 ize all their physical and mental strength\, to sacrifice their lives and 
 property in order to safeguard their independence and liberty."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1934\, a strike involving 400\,000 textile work
 ers from all across the U.S. began\, the largest strike in U.S. history at
  the time. Striking workers faced violence from the state\, private guards
 \, and deputized vigilantes.\n\nThe strike was national in scope - textile
  workers from New England\, the Mid-Atlantic states\, and the U.S. Souther
 n states\, all participated in the Textile Strike of 1934\, which lasted t
 wenty-two days.\n\nIn part due to the labor reforms of the Roosevelt admin
 istration\, union membership had grown greatly in the months leading up to
  the strike. In February 1933\, the United Textile Workers (UTW) had no mo
 re than 15\,000 members. By June 1934\, they had grown to 250\,000 members
 \, half of whom were cotton mill workers.\n\nOn September 3rd\, thousands 
 of workers took the streets in Gastonia\, North Carolina to form a parade 
 celebrating Labor Day. The next day\, approximately 20\,000 out of the 25\
 ,000 textile workers in the county were out on strike. Hundreds of thousan
 ds of textile workers across the country soon followed suit.\n\nStrikers f
 aced violence from state police\, private citizens\, and private guards fo
 r the mills. South Carolina Governor Ibra Blackwood announced that he woul
 d deputize the state's "mayors\, sheriffs\, peace officers and every good 
 citizen" to maintain order. Accordingly\, dozens of protesting workers wer
 e killed as martial law was declared and private guards fired into crowds 
 across the country.\n\nResults of the strike were mixed\, but workers in t
 he South fared particularly badly. Thousands of striking mill workers did 
 not return to the mills and many were blacklisted. Some union officials cl
 aimed victory despite worker demands not being met.\n\nSouthern mill worke
 rs in particular were extremely bitter at the union and its officials for 
 calling off the strike and putting their faith in government boards\, when
  the employers had yet to concede anything.

 27\,000 man hours at the BLSP plant\, which in turn caused the loss of 17\

 . The strike was chronicled by labor historian Ken Weller\, who authored a
  pamphlet discussing the strike in detail\, titled "The B.L.S.P Dispute".\
 n\nAccording to Weller\, workers were unable to get union management to ad
 dress their concerns about suspected upcoming layoffs. On September 4th\, 
 1961\, workers began a wildcat strike\, walking off the job without union 
 authorization.\n\nWeller states that the strike failed\, undermined by the

DESCRIPTION:The Children's Strikes of 1911\, which began on this day that 
 year\, were a series of walk-outs and protests by children across England\
 , Wales\, and Scotland.\n\nThe first strike occurred on the morning of Sep
 tember 5th\, 1911\, when children left their classrooms of Bigyn School\, 
 Llanelli\, protesting at the physical punishment of one of their classmate
 s. During the next three weeks\, school strikes spread in a rapidly accele
 rating wave\, affecting at least 62 town and cities\, stretching as far no
 rth as Montrose in Scotland and as far south as Portsmouth\, involving tho
 usands of children.\n\nReasons for striking ranged from a desire to abolis
 h the cane\, less school work\, more holidays\, and payment for school mon
 itors. Widespread school strikes are very rare events\, with the exception
  of similar strikes in 1889\, the scale of the 1911 strike represents a un
 ique example of collective action by mainly working class school children.

DESCRIPTION:Claudette Colvin\, born on this day in 1939\, is a retired Ame
 rican nurse who was a pioneer of the 1950s civil rights movement\, refusin
 g to give up her bus seat to a white woman at age 15\, nine months before 
 Rosa Parks did the same.\n\nOn March 2nd\, 1955\, she was arrested at the 
 age of fifteen in Montgomery\, Alabama for refusing to give up her seat to
  a white woman on a crowded\, segregated bus. This occurred nine months be
 fore the more widely known incident in which Rosa Parks\, secretary of the
  local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
 People (NAACP)\, helped spark the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n\nFor many
  years\, Montgomery's black leaders did not publicize Colvin's pioneering 
 effort. She was an unmarried teenager at the time\, and was reportedly imp
 regnated by a married man. It is widely accepted that Colvin was not accre
 dited by the civil rights campaigners at the time due to her pregnancy sho
 rtly after the incident\, with even Rosa Parks saying "If the white press 
 got ahold of that information\, they would have [had] a field day. They'd 
 call her a bad girl\, and her case wouldn't have a chance."\n\nColvin left
  Montgomery for New York City in 1958\, because she had difficulty finding
  and keeping work following her participation in the federal court case th
 at overturned bus segregation (similarly\, Rosa Parks left Montgomery for 
 Detroit in 1957). Colvin stated she was branded a troublemaker by many in 
 her community. She withdrew from college and went on to become a nurse in 
 Manhattan.\n\n"My head was just too full of black history\, you know\, the
  oppression that we went through. It felt like Sojourner Truth was on one 
 side pushing me down\, and Harriet Tubman was on the other side of me push
 ing me down. I couldn't get up."\n\n- Claudette Colvin

  anti-apartheid activist Dimitri Tsafendas (1918 - 1999) obtained a tempor

  Town.\n\nWhen Tsafendas first decided to take action against Prime Minist

 low activists did not want to do anything risky\, however\, so Tsafendas d
 ecided to kill Verwoerd instead\, viewing him as the "brains" behind the p

 concealed sheath knife from his belt\, and stabbed him about four times in
  the torso before he was pulled away by other members of parliament.\n\nTs
 afendas was taken into police custody\, where he was severely beaten\, and
  then moved to a hospital where he was treated for his injuries and interv

 led from the proceedings. The court ordered for him to be detained "at the
  pleasure of the State President"\, which meant that only the State Presid
 ent (later President) had the authority to order his release.\n\nHe was ne
 ver discharged and tortured in custody\, dying at the age of eighty-one wh

DESCRIPTION:Benjamin Gold\, born on this day in 1898\, was an American lab
 or leader and Communist Party member who was president of the Internationa
 l Fur and Leather Workers Union (IFLWU) from 1937 to 1955.\n\nIn 1926\, Go
 ld led a fur worker's strike in New York City that included all 12\,000 wo
 rkers in the industry. His leadership style was aggressive\, and the relat
 ively moderate American Federation of Labor (AFL) sought to undermine his 
 influence in the strike\, although their efforts failed due to worker loya
 lty to Gold.\n\nAlthough the strike was ultimately successful due to Gold'
 s efforts\, the AFL expelled him\, accusing Gold and other strike leaders 
 of debauchery\, wasting union money\, bribery\, forcing workers to join th
 e Communist Party\, among other grievances. Despite this\, he remained a p
 owerful figure within the organized labor of the fur industry\, often comp
 eting directly with AFL-backed unions for influence among workers.\n\nGold
  was also a victim of anti-communist purges on many occasions. In 1950\, G
 old resigned from the Communist Party and signed an anti-communist oath re
 lated to the Taft-Hartley Act. The Justice Department argued that Gold had
  not really resigned\, and indicted him for perjury in August 1953 one day
  before the statute of limitations ran out.\n\nAlthough he was successfull
 y convicted\, Gold managed to get the conviction overturned on appeal to t
 he U.S. Supreme Court (Gold v. United States) and all charges were dropped
 .

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1965\, the Delano Grape Strike began\, lasting 
 an astonishing five years before finally succeeding in 1970. During the st
 rike\, labor groups involved merged to form the landmark United Farm Worke
 rs (UFW).\n\nThe Delano Grape Strike was organized by the Agricultural Wor
 kers Organizing Committee (AWOC)\, a predominantly Filipino and AFL-CIO-sp
 onsored labor organization\, against table grape growers in Delano\, Calif
 ornia to fight against the exploitation of farm workers.\n\nThe strike beg
 an on September 8th\, 1965 and was soon joined by the National Farmworkers
  Association (NFWA). The labor action lasted for an astonishing five years
  and was characterized by its grassroots tactics - consumer boycotts\, mar
 ches\, community organizing and nonviolent resistance - which achieved nat
 ional attention.\n\nFilipino strike leader Andy Imutan noted that growers 
 used race as a means to divide workers\, writing: "The struggle became a l
 ot harder when Mexican workers started crossing our picket lines. There wa
 s no unity between the Mexicans and the Filipinos. The growers were very s
 uccessful in dividing us and creating conflict between the two races...So 
 Larry Itliong and I decided to take action by seeing Cesar Chavez\, the le
 ader of the National Farm Workers Association...It took several discussion
 s and a lot of faith\, but finally the Filipinos and Mexicans joined as on
 e on September 16th to picket the Delano growers."\n\nIn July 1970\, strik
 ers finally achieved a collective bargaining agreement with major table gr
 ape growers\, affecting more than 10\,000 farm workers. In August 1966\, t
 he AWOC and the NFWA merged to create the United Farm Workers (UFW) Organi
 zing Committee.\n\nThe Delano Grape Strike is notable for the effective im
 plementation and adaptation of boycotts\, the unprecedented partnership be
 tween Filipino and Mexican farm workers to unionize farm labor\, and the c
 reation of the UFW labor union\, all of which revolutionized the farm labo
 r movement in America.

 y 100 wounded.\n\nBased upon prisoners' demands for better living conditio
 ns and political rights\, the uprising was one of the most well-known and 
 significant flashpoints of the Prisoners' Rights Movement.\n\nThe rebellio
 n began two weeks after the killing of imprisoned revolutionary George Jac
 kson at San Quentin State Prison. The conditions of the prison were extrem
 ely overcrowded\, with the population around 2\,243 - more than double of 
 the facility's designed limit of 1\,200.\n\nHistorian Howard Zinn describe
 d the conditions at the prison this way: "Prisoners spent 14 to 16 hours a
  day in their cells\, their mail was read\, their reading material restric

 edical care disgraceful\, their parole system inequitable\, racism everywh
 ere."\n\nOn the morning of September 9th\, 1971\, fighting broke out betwe
 en inmates and prison officers\, leading to ~1\,200 prisoners to control a
 bout half of the facility by noon. One officer involved died of his injuri
 es two days later\, and inmates took 42 hostages and began drafting a set 
 of demands to be met before they would surrender.\n\nPrisoners met with th
 e press\, and a 21-year old speaker\, Elliot "L.D." Barkley\, delivered a 
 "Declaration to the People of America" the same day inmates seized control
  of the prison.\n\nAfter four days of fruitless negotiations and escalatin

 used to come to the scene in person) ordered that the prison be retaken by
  force. 39 people\, mostly inmates\, were killed in a 15-minute assault by
  state police\, including Barkley.\n\n"We are men! We are not beasts and w

 resident who earned the ire of the United Fruit Company\, the largest priv

 was ousted in a U.S-backed coup in 1954.\n\nÁrbenz served as the Minister
  of National Defense from 1944 to 1951 and the second democratically elect
 ed President of Guatemala from 1951 to 1954. He was a major figure in the 
 ten-year Guatemalan Revolution\, which represented some of the few years o
 f representative democracy in Guatemalan history.\n\nÁrbenz instituted ma
 ny popular reforms\, including an expanded right to vote\, the right of wo
 rkers to organize\, legitimizing political parties\, and allowing public d
 ebate.\n\nThe centerpiece of Árbenz' policy was an agrarian reform law\, 
 under which uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated
  in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricult
 ural laborers. Approximately 500\,000 people benefited from the decree\, t
 he majority of them indigenous people whose forebears had been dispossesse
 d after the Spanish invasion.\n\nOpposition to these policies led the Unit

  interracial projects. The clinic was publicized in the African-American p

  efforts were also later lauded by MLK Jr.\n\nAlthough Sanger rejected rac

  were involved in the strike\, which affected the wages sustaining 43\,000
  people\, or about 26% of the population of metropolitan Sudbury. By the e
 nd of the strike\, nine months later\, the company had been deprived of ov

  now have more people receiving payments from the pension roll than pay ro

  sailors of the British Atlantic Fleet rebelled in response to widespread 
 pay cuts. The mutiny caused an economic panic which forced the government 
 off the Gold Standard.\n\nThe widespread pay cuts were brought by the Brit

 In the Navy\, these cuts manifested as a 10% pay cut for officers and seni

 fore 1925.\n\nOn the morning of September 15th\, sailors on four capital s
 hips due to sail had began disobeying orders. On the Hood and the Nelson\,
  crews carried out the ordinary harbor routine\, refusing to put to sea (l
 eave land for a voyage)\; on the Valiant and the Rodney\, crews carried ou
 t only essential duties\, including the provision of safety patrols and fi
 re guards\, and did so without any recourse to their officers.\n\nBy the s

 the lower ranked members now only receiving a 10% pay cut. A number of the
  strike organizers were jailed and 397 sailors were discharged from the Na
 vy in the uprising's aftermath.\n\nThe mutiny inspired widespread working 
 class resistance. Socialist Review magazine notes that\, in the wake of th
 e Invergordon uprising\, massive demonstrations against wage cuts and unem
 ployment took place. On September 21st\, the British government walked bac
 k pay cuts for teachers and policemen following a massive domestic demonst
 ration.\n\nOn October 7th\, the National Unemployed Workers' Movement led 
 a riot of 50\,000 unemployed in Glasgow. The next day\, 30\,000 did likewi
 se in Manchester\, followed by another demonstration of 60\,000 in Glasgow
 . The offices of the Communist Party's Daily Worker were raided and and st

  rule\, died in a boating accident\, which at least one historian has clai

 g Kapp Putsch\, Hoelz organized workers from Falkenstein and Oelsnitz in a
  Red Guard\, leading armed bands against the police\, the army\, and the f
 ar-right paramilitary Freikorps. In this role\, he became Robin Hood-like 
 figure\, raising money from employers under threat of reprisals\, liberati
 ng prisoners\, destroying property deeds and police archives\, and burning
  villas of the rich.\n\nLater in life\, after the Nazis began to come into
  power\, Hoelz moved to Soviet Russia\, however he became a dissident\, cr

 n Act.\n\nOn September 15th\, 1954\, Crawford Morgan\, a black member of V
 ALB\, testified before the SACB. Here is an excerpt of his testimony:\n\nS
 ACB: "Did you have any understanding\, Mr. Morgan\, before you went to Spa
 in\, of what the issues were connected to that war?"\n\nMorgan: "I felt th
 at I had a pretty good idea of what fascism was and most of its ramificati
 ons. Being aware of what the Fascist Italian government did to the Ethiopi
 ans\, and also the way that I and all the rest of the Negroes in this coun
 try have been treated ever since slavery\, I figured I had a pretty good i
 dea of what fascism was..."\n\nSACB: "Mr. Morgan\, were those thoughts in 
 your mind before you went to Spain?"\n\nMorgan: "Ever since I have been bi
 g enough to understand things I have rebelled. As a small child of three o
 r four years old I would rebel at human injustice in the way I understood 
 it at that age. And as long as I have been able to remember\, up until now
 \, the government and a lot of people have treated me as a second-class ci
 tizen. I am 43 years old\, and all my life I have been treated as a second
 -class citizen\, and naturally if you always have been treated like one yo
 u start feeling it at a very tender age.\n\nWith Hitler on the march\, and
  fascism starting the fight in Spain\, I felt that it could serve two purp
 oses: I felt that if we cold lick the Fascists in Spain\, I felt that in t
 he trend of things it would offset a bloodbath later. I felt that if we di
 dn't lick Franco and stop fascism there\, it would spread over lots of the
  world. And it is bad enough for white people to live under fascism\, thos
 e of the white people that like freedom and democracy. But Negroes couldn'
 t live under it. They would be wiped out."

 as a feminist and anarchist writer. She was highly critical of the existin
 g political system in Japan\, which led her to call for an anarchism to ex
 ist in "everyday practice"\, namely that people should in various small wa
 ys seek routinely to undermine the kokutai (a sense of national body polit
 ic). Itō also translated anarchist writings into Japanese\, including wor

 6-year-old nephew Munekazu were arrested\, strangled to death\, and thrown
  into an abandoned well by a squad of military police known as the "Kenpei

  U.S. Congress as part of the Compromise of 1850\, compelling all in free 
 states to return fugitive slaves to their would-be masters and banning sus

 d on the racialized terror of the previous Fugitive Slave Act of 1793\, wr
 itten with the intent to enforce Article 4\, Section 2\, Clause 3 of the C
 onstitution\, which required the return of runaway enslaved people.\n\nThe
  Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 compelled all authorities in free states to re
 turn fugitives of enslavement to their masters\, penalizing officials who 
 did not arrest an alleged runaway slave\, prevented suspected slaves from 
 asking for a jury trial or testifying on their own behalf\, and subjected 
 any person aiding a fugitive slave by providing food or shelter with six m

 troversial elements of the 1850 compromise\; abolitionists nicknamed it th
 e "Bloodhound Bill". The political fallout from its passage is considered 
 by some historians to be one of the causes of the Civil War.

 mob - approximately a dozen marchers were killed and 30-40 wounded. The Ca

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1893\, New Zealand became the first country wit
 h a Western-style parliament that allowed women to vote in its elections. 
 Women's suffrage was granted after about two decades of campaigning throug
 hout New Zealand\, led by women such as Kate Sheppard (shown) and Mary Ann
  Müller.\n\nThe activists delivered a series of petitions to Parliament -
  over 9\,000 signatures were delivered in 1891\, followed by a petition of
  almost 20\,000 signatures in 1892\, and finally in 1893 nearly 32\,000 si
 gnatures were presented\, almost a quarter of the adult European female po
 pulation of New Zealand. Through this popular pressure\, a bill was passed
  that granted women the right to vote.\n\nSome historians have noted that 
 colonialism was regressive for women's rights in New Zealand. Writing for 
 The Guardian\, Emma Espiner stated:\n\n"The settler scholars who transmute
 d our oral language into a written one reframed our myths and legends so t
 hat our female deities were subservient to the male. These same 'historian
 s' assumed that our chiefs were all men and wrote them into the histories 
 as such.\n\nOur pronouns and many of our names were gender-neutral long be
 fore the concept became a source of anxiety for conservative columnists\, 
 so it was straightforward for ethnographers to assign a male gender to the
  chiefs named in our oral tradition. Māori women leaders simply disappear

 tes\, Paulo Freire was exiled from his home country\, an exile that lasted
  16 years.\n\nFreire then worked in Chile\, until April 1969 when he accep
 ted a temporary position at Harvard University. It was during this period\
 , in 1968\, that Freire published his most famous work\, "Pedagogy of the 
 Oppressed".\n\nIn this text\, Freire criticizes what he calls the "banking
  method" of education\, wherein a teacher "deposits" knowledge into an emp
 ty vessel\, the student\, or "bank". Instead\, Freire calls upon teacher t
 o engage in a more dialog-centric or creative education\, one in which the
  suppressed experiences of the oppressed help create knowledge\, fostering
  a social reality in which the marginalized are humanized.\n\nPedagogy of 
 the Oppressed has since become the third most cited book in the social sci
 ences\, according to Elliott D. Green. As of 2000\, the book had sold over
  750\,000 copies worldwide.\n\n"Manipulation\, sloganizing\, depositing\, 
 regimentation\, and prescription cannot be components of revolutionary pra
 xis\, precisely because they are the components of the praxis of dominatio
 n."\n\n- Paulo Freire

 anized and sponsored by the AFL-CIO\, and came a few weeks into the Profes

 first major demonstration organized in decades by the AFL-CIO. Ultimately\
 , the rally's show of support was ineffectual\; PATCO was de-certified as 
 a union and the striking ATC workers did not get their jobs back.\n\nA 2nd
  Solidarity March was held near the 10 year anniversary of the original So
 lidary Day March. Union members\, in the wake of the Gulf War\, called on 
 the federal government to turn its attention away from foreign affairs and
  to focus on domestic issues like improving health care and education and 
 supporting workers' rights. Approximately 250\,000-500\,000 people took pa

 der of the Haitian Revolution and the first ruler of an independent Haiti 
 under the 1805 constitution. Dessalines was assassinated by rebels in 1806
 \, leading directly to civil war.\n\nDessalines was born to an enslaved Co
 ngolese family in 1758. He adopted the name Dessalines after escaping from
  a free black landowner who had purchased him.\n\nIn 1794\, Dessalines's m
 ilitary skill and leadership were vital to L'Overture's success in capturi

 verture made him governor of the south.\n\nAfter L'Overture's betrayal and
  death in 1802-03\, Dessalines became a key leader of the Haitian Revoluti

 In 1804\, Dessalines appointed himself emperor for life and ordered mass k
 illings of all the French colonizers remaining on the island\, leading to 
 the deaths of 3000-5000 French people of all ages and sexes. He declared "
 I have saved my country. I have avenged America."\n\nThe 1805 Constitution
  established by Dessalines' government made Haiti the first country in his
 tory to abolish slavery. The Constitution also guaranteed equality under t
 he law\, freedom of religion\, and protected property rights\, with an exc
 eption - "No whiteman of whatever nation he may be\, shall put his foot on
  this territory with the title of master or proprietor\, neither shall he 
 in future acquire any property therein".\n\nIn 1806\, Dessalines was assas
 sinated by rebels outside Port-au-Prince\, leading directly to civil war o

  that workers suffered shocked and galvanized its readers to such a degree
  that domestic and foreign purchases of American meat to fall by half and 
 federal regulations of the meat industry increased.\n\nSinclair also discr

 nThe Winter of Discontent took place during 1978-79 in the United Kingdom\
 , characterized by widespread strikes from both private and public sector 
 trade unions. Some of these industrial disputes caused great public inconv
 enience\, exacerbated by the coldest winter in 16 years in which severe st

 8\, one of the first strikes of the "Winter of Discontent" began when 15\,
 000 Ford workers\, mostly from the Transport and General Workers Union (TG
 WU)\, began an unofficial strike.\n\nThe number of participants later grew
  to 57\,000. As the months progressed\, workers from multiple industries w
 ent on strike\, including lorry drivers\, garbage collectors\, and gravedi
 ggers. It was the largest UK labor stoppage since 1926.\n\nThe Winter was 
 a disaster for the incumbent Labour Party. The magazine Socialist Worker q
 uoted one council worker as saying "We had to strike because Labour betray
 ed us".\n\nThe Labour Party was swept out of power in the 1979 election\, 
 leading to the premiership of Margaret Thatcher.

  publication of "The Feminine Mystique" by Betty Friedan\, a fellow femini

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1994\, in opposition to water bill increases\, 
 working class Irish activists began a campaign of resistance\, refusing to
  pay water bills and engaging in direct action to prevent peoples' water s
 upplies from being shut off.\n\nTo facilitate this campaign\, activists fo
 rmed the Federation of Dublin Anti-Water Charges Campaigns (FDAWCC).\n\nA 
 protest march five hundred strong took place in the city center in Novembe
 r\, and\, over the course of late 1994/early 1995. nearly every house in F
 ingal and South Dublin had received a leaflet from the campaign.\n\nIn res
 ponse to the water bill strike\, the city declared that\, if people didn't
  pay their outstanding bills within a certain number of days\, they would 
 begin cutting off peoples' water supply. In response\, the community follo
 wed and spied on water inspectors in order to prevent them from shutting o
 ff the water supply to various homes.\n\nLegal action escalated\, and some
  residents were called into court over unpaid water charges. Despite this\
 , very few people were actually issued disconnections\, and more than 50% 
 of houses were not paying their water bills. Finally\, on December 19th\, 
 1996 the Minister for the Environment announced that the water charge woul
 d be done away with.

 se acts of violence resistance against the British and execution at 23 yea

 was an avid reader of Bakunin\, Marx\, Lenin\, and Trotsky. He was also op
 enly critical of Mahatma Gandhi\, having become disillusioned with his non
 -violent tactics after Gandhi called off the non-cooperation movement.\n\n
 In December 1928\, Bhagat Singh and an associate fatally shot a 21-year-ol
 d British police officer\, John Saunders\, in retaliation for the death of
  Lala Lajpat Rai\, a popular Indian nationalist leader who died after bein
 g attacked by police. On the run from the police\, Singh was arrested when

 Das in a hunger strike\, demanding better prison conditions for Indian pri

COMMENT:David Walker was an American abolitionist and author who published

 lcolm X.
DESCRIPTION:David Walker (1796 - 1830) was an American abolitionist and au
 thor who published "An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World" on th
 is day in 1829. The piece was an early historical call for black unity in 
 the fight against slavery.\n\nThe text was widely read at the time and has
  become regarded as one of the most important political documents of the 1
 9th century\, influencing multiple generations of black leaders that came 
 after it\, including Frederick Douglass\, W.E.B. Du Bois\, Martin Luther K
 ing\, and Malcolm X. Not surprisingly\, the text infuriated southern slave
 owners\; the state of Georgia offered a $10\,000 bounty for Walker alive a
 nd $1\,000 for him dead.\n\nWalker died the next year\, soon after publish
 ing the third edition of his Appeal. Although foul play was suspected\, hi
 storians consider it more likely he died of tuberculosis\, which his daugh
 ter had passed away from a week prior. David Walker's son\, Edward G. Walk
 er\, was an attorney and\, in 1866\, was one of the first two black men el
 ected to the Massachusetts State Legislature.\n\n"Now\, I ask you\, had yo
 u not rather be killed than to be a slave to a tyrant\, who takes the life
  of your mother\, wife\, and dear little children? Look upon your mother\,
  wife and children\, and answer God Almighty\; and believe this\, that it 
 is no more harm for you to kill a man who is trying to kill you\, than it 
 is for you to take a drink of water when thirsty."\n\n- David Walker

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1946\, months of spontaneous peasant uprisings 
 began in Korea after rail workers struck in Daegu. Millions participated\,
  attacking Japanese and US collaborators and burning rice collection recor
 ds as the state imposed martial law.\n\nAccording to political sociologist
  Gi-Wook Shin\, the uprising began on October 1st\, 1946 when 300 railroad
  workers initiated a strike in the South Korean city of Taegu (also spelle
 d Daegu). The following morning\, thousands of workers carried the body of
  a striker murdered by police throughout the city and then raided the loca
 l police station\, capturing 50 policemen.\n\nBy October 6th\, 38 Taegu po
 licemen had been killed\, martial law was declared\, and American tanks we
 re patrolling the city. The uprising that began in Taegu had also expanded
  into rural areas\, transforming the urban strike into a major national up
 rising.\n\nParticipants of the 1946 uprisings targeted rice collection age
 ncies\, landlords\, and policemen and city officials who had collaborated 
 with the Japanese and American occupiers. Rebels wrecked the homes of poli
 ce officers and burned records of grain and rice collections.\n\nGi-Wook S
 hin notes that\, by the end of 1946\, approximately 30% of South Korean co
 unties had bore witness to these peasant uprisings. While no accurate coun
 t of participants or casualties exists\, Shin provides estimates of 2.3 mi
 llion people participating in the uprising\, 30\,000 protesters arrested\,
  and 1\,000 protesters and 200 police officers killed in total.\n\nProfess
 or of Korea-Pacific Studies Stephan Haggard has noted the defeat of the up
 rising as a turning point for the power struggle in Korea\, as the PRK peo
 ple's committees and the National Council of Korean Labor Unions were weak
 ened by the suppression.

COMMENT:On this day in 1965\, the September 30th Movement assassinated six

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1965\, the September 30th Movement assassinated
  six Indonesian Generals\, beginning a period of West-backed mass murder o
 f alleged communists\, religious minorities\, and ethnic Chinese people. A
 t least 500\,000 were killed.\n\nThe assassinations were blamed on the Com
 munist Party on Indonesia (KPI) by the army and various civic and religiou
 s groups\, and the resulting campaign of mass murder and arrests\, backed 
 by several Western powers\, led to the ousting of Indonesian nationalist P
 resident Sukarno\, the deaths of anywhere from 500\,000 to 3 million peopl
 e\, and the installation of Suharto\, a brazenly corrupt anti-communist\, 
 as President.\n\nBlaming the KPI for the assassination of the generals\, S
 uharto's forces began purging insitutions of alleged Sukarno and PKI loyal
 ists\, arresting and summarily executing many important PKI figures. As le
 ftists\, real or alleged\, were violently removed from civil and military 
 institutions\, reactionaries began directing violence towards ordinary civ
 ilians.\n\nThe campaign of repression was both widespread and brutal\; vic
 tims were tortured\, impaled\, beheaded\, and rivers were left congested w
 ith masses of corpses. The most conservative estimates suggest 500\,000 pe
 ople were killed in total\, while higher estimates range from 2-3 million.
 \n\nWestern powers\, including the U.S.\, Britain\, Australia\, and Sweden
 \, both supported and directly aided the anti-communist pogroms. In 1962\,
  three years before the killings began\, both the U.S. and British governm
 ents that it would be necessary "to liquidate Sukarno".\n\nThe U.S. traine
 d more than 1\,200 anti-communist military officers\, providing them weapo
 ns and economic assistance. During the massacres\, the U.S. supported the 
 Indonesian military's actions\, even providing the government with lists o
 f suspected communists to target.\n\nBritish Foreign Office documents decl
 assified in 2021 revealed that British propagandists secretly incited anti
 -communists\, including army generals\, to eliminate the PKI\, and used "b
 lack propaganda"\, propaganda intended to create the impression that it wa
 s created by those it is supposed to discredit\, due to Sukarno's hostilit
 y to the formation of former British colonies into the Malayan federation 
 from 1963.\n\nWestern media and politicians repeated false propaganda from
  Suharto's Indonesian government downplaying the violence while also celeb
 rating the violent repression taking place. Australian Prime Minister Haro
 ld Holt wrote in the NY Times "With 500\,000 to 1 million Communist sympat
 hizers knocked off\, I think it is safe to assume a reorientation has take
 n place" The NY Times also published a racist article saying the murders w
 ere to be expected in "violent Asia\, where life is cheap".\n\nAmerican oi
 l tycoon H. L. Hunt called Sukarno's ousting the "greatest victory for fre
 edom since the last decisive battle of World War II." Time magazine descri
 bed the suppression of the KPI "The West's best news for years in Asia" an
 d praised Suharto as "scrupulously constitutional."\n\nThe politicide ende
 d in 1966. Sukarno died under house arrest in 1970. Suharto would rule as 
 head of the Western-backed military "New Order" regime for over 30 years\,
  while amassing a personal fortune. The massacres continue to be downplaye
 d in the official Indonesian historiography.\n\nIn his 2020 book "The Jaka
 rta Method"\, journalist Vincent Bevins argues that the massacre provided 
 the blueprint for American campaigns of suppression of leftist movements a
 round the world. To this day\, no Western government has apologized for th
 eir involvement in the Indonesian politicide.

 iven on October 2nd\, 1937:\n\n"To the Dominicans who were complaining of 
 the depredations by Haitians living among them\, thefts of cattle\, provis
 ions\, fruits\, etc.\, and were thus prevented from enjoying in peace the 
 products of their labor\, I have responded\, 'I will fix this.' And we hav
 e already begun to remedy the situation. Three hundred Haitians are now de
 ad in Bánica. This remedy will continue."\n\nIn the following week\, hund
 reds of Dominican troops poured into the region\, killing Haitians with ri
 fles\, machetes\, shovels\, knives\, and bayonets. Haitian children were t
 hrown in the air and caught by soldiers' bayonets\, then thrown on their m
 others' corpses. Others were drowned in the sea\, making identification an
 d counting of the dead impossible.\n\nThe term "Parsley Massacre" for the 
 genocide came from the method that Dominican soldiers would use to determi
 ne whether or not those living on the border were native Dominicans or imm
 igrant Haitians - they would hold up a sprig of parsley to someone and ask
  them what it was.\n\nIf the person could pronounce it the Spanish way ("p
 erejil")\, the soldiers considered them Dominican and let them live\, howe
 ver if they pronounced it with a French or Creole accent\, they were consi
 dered Haitian and executed.\n\n"Before the massacre\, in the frontier\, th
 ere were always two sides\, the people were one\, united."\n\n- an anonymo

 to protest the government's actions and listen peacefully to speeches.\n\n
 Although the Mexican government stated gunfire from the surrounding apartm

 saw a military flare go up as a sign to begin firing on the crowd. The gov

 dicalized Subcomandante Marcos\, who later became a prominent member of th
 e Zapatistas\, an indigenous group that fights for liberation from the Mex
 ican government.\n\nThe massacre also led CIA agent Philip Agee\, an eyewi

 World (IWW). In 1915\, he was convicted of murder in a controversial trial
  and executed by the state.\n\nHill\, an immigrant worker frequently facin

 len Keller.\n\n"I will die like a true-blue rebel. Don't waste any time in
  mourning - organize."\n\n- Joe Hill

  and jury service\, just as their parents\, grandparents\, and great-grand
 parents once were".\n\nAlexander's analysis shows how "people whose only c
 rime is drug addiction or possession of a small amount of drugs for recrea

  also illustrating how the legal system has shut out attempts to combat th

 ppears voluntary. People choose to commit crimes\, and that's why they are
  locked up or locked out\, we are told."\n\n- Michelle Alexander

 s in the 1921 rural strikes of Argentine Patagonia.\n\nIn early 1921\, Pat
 agonic landowners were refusing to make concessions to an increasingly dis

  maintaining of poor working conditions. In response to this\, a general s
 trike was declared on March 25th.\n\nSoto and his comrades traveled along 
 farms of the cordillera of the Andes recruiting rural workers of several l
 arge farms\, driving the southeast of Santa Cruz into an uprising. They re
 quisitioned arms and food for the campaign\, granting vouchers promising t
 o eventually return the goods and occasionally taking the landowners and m
 anagers hostage.\n\nIn the aftermath of the strike\, Soto fled the country
  and settled in Puntas Aras\, Chile. There\, he managed a small hotel whic
 h served as a meeting place of libertarians\, intellectuals\, and free-thi
 nkers and founded the "Centro Republicano Español". His tombstone can be

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1967\, communist revolutionary Che Guevara was 
 executed by CIA-assisted forces in Bolivia\, where he had been attempting 
 to foment revolution. His last words were "Shoot\, you are only going to k
 ill a man."\n\nErnesto "Che" Guevara was an Argentine Marxist revolutionar
 y\, physician\, author\, guerrilla leader\, diplomat\, and military theori
 st. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution\, his stylized visage has becom
 e a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in 
 popular culture.\n\nAfter serving in Castro's government\, Guevara left Cu
 ba in 1965 to foment revolution abroad\, first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kin
 shasa and later in Bolivia. While agitating for communist revolution in Bo
 livia\, Guevara was captured by CIA-assisted state forces and summarily ex
 ecuted on this day in 1967.\n\nOn November 3rd\, 1966\, Guevara had secret
 ly arrived in La Paz on a flight from Montevideo under the false name Adol
 fo Mena González\, posing as a middle-aged Uruguayan businessman working 
 for the Organization of American States (OAS). Once there\, Guevara had di
 fficulty getting cooperation from both local dissidents and the Bolivian C
 ommunist Party\, despite besting the Bolivian military in several skirmish
 es.\n\nTo help crush the resistance movement\, the Bolivian government and
  U.S. military relied on the expertise of fugitive Nazi war criminal Klaus
  Barbie\, who had undermined the French Resistance and was responsible for
  the torture and murder of its leader\, Jean Moulin.\n\nSome of the inhabi
 tants willingly informed the Bolivian authorities and military about the g
 uerrillas and their movements in the area\, which contributed to Guevara's
  capture on October 7th\, 1967. He famously shouted "Do not shoot! I am Ch
 e Guevara and I am worth more to you alive than dead!"\, however he remain
 ed defiant in captivity.\n\nOn October 9th\, on orders from the Bolivian P
 resident René Barrientos\, Guevara was executed. In the documentary "My E
 nemy's Enemy"\, German journalist Kai Hermann alleged that Barbie devised 
 the strategy that led to Guevara's capture.\n\n"The true revolutionary is 
 guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine 
 revolutionary lacking this quality."\n\n- Che Guevara

DESCRIPTION:Nikolai Bukharin\, born on this day in 1888\, was a Bolshevik 
 revolutionary and Marxist theorist who\, with Stalin\, helped oust Leon Tr
 otsky in 1927. His controversial trial and execution in 1938 alienated com
 munist sympathizers in the West.\n\nAs a young man\, Bukharin joined the R
 ussian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906\, becoming a member of the B
 olshevik faction. He served on a committee that was infiltrated by the Tsa
 rist secret police\, the Okhrana\, and was imprisoned and exiled in 1911.\
 n\nIn 1911\, Bukharin escaped exile\, fleeing to Germany. During this peri
 od\, he met Vladimir Lenin for the first time and authored "Imperialism an
 d World Economy"\, a work that predated and influenced Lenin's "Imperialis
 m\, the Highest Stage of Capitalism".\n\nAfter Lenin's death in 1924\, Buk
 harin became a full member of the Politburo\, allying himself with Stalin 
 in the power struggles of that period. Bukharin formulated the thesis of "
 Socialism in One Country" put forth by Stalin in 1924\, which argued that 
 socialism could be developed in a single country\, even one as underdevelo
 ped as Russia.\n\nBukharin was aligned with the forces that defeated Leon 
 Trotsky\, Lev Kamenev\, and Grigory Zinoviev in various power struggles wi
 thin the Communist Party. A supporter of the market-based New Economic Pol
 icy (NEP)\, Bukharin opposed Stalin's support of collectivization policies
  in the late 1920s. On this basis\, he was criticized and began politicall
 y conspiring against Stalin.\n\nAfter the trial and execution of Zinoviev\
 , Kamenev\, and other "Old Bolsheviks" in 1936\, Bukharin was arrested in 
 1937 and charged with conspiring to overthrow the Soviet state. The follow
 ing trial was controversial and drew international criticism\, alienating 
 some communist sympathizers abroad.\n\nFrench author Romain Rolland wrote 
 to Stalin directly\, arguing that "an intellect like that of Bukharin is a
  treasure for his country" and drawing comparisons to the execution of che
 mist Antoine Lavoisier\, guillotined during the French Revolution: "We in 
 France\, the most ardent revolutionaries...still profoundly grieve and reg
 ret what we did...I beg you to show clemency." Bukharin was executed by gu
 nshot on March 15th\, 1938\, at the Kommunarka shooting ground.\n\n"We see
  now that infringement of freedom is necessary with regard to the opponent
 s of the revolution. At a time of revolution we cannot allow freedom for t
 he enemies of the people and of the revolution. That is a surely clear\, i
 rrefutable conclusion."\n\n- Nikolai Bukharin

  United States.\n\nWithin a few days (sources differ on the exact day\, ra

  soldiers entered Panama City. Stationing themselves at Parque de Santa An

 ts of Tenants' League leaders\, quickly crushing the uprising by arresting
  its prime organizers.\n\nWhile the uprising was ongoing\, government offi

 to back off of demanding release\, but only in exchange for the opportunit

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1972\, ESL staff from South Seattle Community C
 ollege\, students\, and families occupied a vacant school building in the 
 Beacon Hill neighborhood\, founding El Centro de la Raza ("The Center for 
 the People of All Races").\n\nAfter three months of occupying the building
  and numerous rallies\, petitions and letters\, the Seattle City Council f
 inally agreed to hear the case of the occupiers. Although City Council app
 roved the lease\, Mayor Wes Uhlman vetoed the action\, causing supporters 
 to occupy the mayor's office. A five-year lease signed January 20th\, 1973
 \, at $1 rent annually.\n\nAccording to author David Wilma\, in 1997 the s
 chool district insisted on fair market rates\, causing rent for the proper
 ty to rise to $12\,000 a month. By 1999\, El Centro owed $150\,000 in back
  rent. Grants from the City of Seattle and from Washington state totaling 
 $1 million finally allowed El Centro to buy the site from the school distr
 ict.\n\nToday\, El Centro de la Raza continues to function as an education
 al\, cultural\, and social service agency. It is considered a significant 
 part of civil rights history in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn 2015\, El Cen
 tro de la Raza built more than one hundred moderately-priced apartments so
 uth of its main building. The apartments are designed for families making 
 30-60% of the average median annual income in Seattle\, or $24\,000 to $49
 \,000.

 fter a union he founded petitioned the King for universal suffrage and leg
 al equality\, Thrane was imprisoned.\n\nBorn into a bourgeois family\, Thr
 ane was orphaned at the early age of 15 and spent the rest of his youth st
 udying abroad in Europe. He returned to Norway\, working as an educator.\n
 \nIn 1848\, Thrane began working as the editor of the local newspaper Dram
 mens Adresse. Inspired by the February Revolution in France\, Thrane expre
 ssed radical political opinions and was dismissed from the position after 
 less than a year.\n\nAround this time\, Thrane founded the Drammens arbeid
 erforening (Drammen Labour Union) and began publishing the union's paper. 
 Between 1849-50\, the trade union movement (also called the Thranite Movem
 ent) grew very quickly\, to approximately 30\,000 members.\n\nMembers of t
 he Thranite Movement were both urban and rural - both small farmers in the
  countryside and urban craftsmen participated.\n\nThis trade union movemen
 t is often associated with a petition presented to King Oscar I on May 19t
 h\, 1850. The petition\, backed by nearly 13\,000 signatures\, demanded un
 iversal suffrage\, abolition of protective tariffs\, reform of the public 
 school\, and improvement of householders ' conditions.\n\nOver the followi
 ng years\, this growing labor movement was repressed by the state - its le
 adership\, including Thrane\, were surveilled\, arrested on false charges\
 , and imprisoned. These tactics successfully broke the Thranite Movement\,
  and Thrane himself left Norway for the U.S. in 1863.\n\nIn 1890\, Thrane 
 died in Wisconsin. His remains were returned to Norway in 1949\, and he is
  buried in the Æreslunden at Vår Frelser's cemetery in Oslo.

  became a kind of "Robin Hood"\, raising money from employers under threat
  of reprisals\, liberating prisoners\, destroying property deeds and polic

 cumentary "Eyes on the Prize II"\, Seale described the founding of the BPP
  in his own words:\n\n"Black Panther Party\, 1966\, when Huey and I founde
 d that organization\, that particular year\, numerous acts of police bruta
 lity had sparked a lot of spontaneous riots\, something that Huey and I we
 re against\, the spontaneous riots.\n\nEven a year earlier\, in 1965\, in 
 Watts\, you know\, sixty-five people were killed\, 200 wounded\, 5\,000 ar
 rested. And Huey and I began to try to figure out how could we organize 5\
 ,000 youthful Black folks into some kind of political-electorial power mov
 ement.\n\nStokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] was on the scene with Black Powe
 r. We were questioning\, Huey and I\, about the need for a functional defi
 nition of power and we came up with this\, that 'power is the ability to d
 efine phenomena then in turn make it act in a desired manner.'\n\nWith the
  phenomena of racism structured in the city council at that time\, Huey an
 d I working with the North Oakland Neighborhood Service Center\, the advis
 ory board\, we got 5\,000 signatures for them to go to the city council\, 
 to get the city council to try to set up a police review board to deal wit
 h complaints of police brutality. Well\, the city council ignored them.\n\
 nSo\, that phenomena was that the city council was just a racist structure
  which could care less about the forty-eight percent Black and Chicano peo
 ple who lived in the city of Oakland. So\, there we are trying to figure o
 ut what to do. We finally concluded through those months that we had to st
 art a new organization.\n\nAnd we sit down and began to write out this Ten
 -Point Platform and Program in the North Oakland Neighborhood Service Cent
 er in North Oakland\, California\, in the community where Huey and I lived
 . And we wrote out this program.\n\n'We want power to determine our own de
 stiny in our own Black community'\, alluding to the needs to be organized-
 political electoral power. Full employment\, decent housing\, decent educa
 tion that taught us about our true selves\, not to have to fight in Vietna
 m\, immediate end to police brutality and murder of back people was point 
 number seven.\n\nThe right to have juries of our peers in the courts\, wha
 t have you. We summed it up. We wanted land\, bread\, housing\, education\
 , clothing\, justice\, and peace. And\, in the tail end\, we stuck in two 
 famous paragraphs: 'When in the course of human events it becomes necessar
 y for one people to separate themself from the political bondage' - that w
 as the emphasis\, the political bondage - 'which have connected them with 
 another\, and to assume among the powers of the Earth the separate and equ
 al station to which the laws of nature and nature's God entitled them.'\n\
 nI mean\, this was the kind of summarization we gave to our meaning. And w
 e summarized that Ten-Point Platform Program\, flipped a coin to see who w
 ould be chairman. I won chairman and we created the Black Panther Party."

COMMENT:Enver Hoxha\, born on this day in 1908\, was the communist leader 
 of Albania from 1946 to 1985. "Every departure from class struggle has fat
 al results for the destiny of socialism."
DESCRIPTION:Enver Hoxha\, born on this day in 1908\, was the communist lea
 der of Albania from 1946 to 1985\, leaving behind a complex legacy of femi
 nism and greatly improved access to healthcare and education\, coupled wit
 h what critics perceive as a paranoid personality cult and brutal state re
 pression.\n\nHoxha is also known for having sharp ideological and politica
 l disagreements with the Soviet Union and communist Yugoslavia\, siding mo
 st strongly with and receiving aid from Maoist China.\n\nBefore coming int
 o power\, Hoxha was a French school teacher and librarian\, becoming a com
 munist partisan after fascist Italy invaded Albania in 1939. In March 1943
 \, the first National Conference of the Communist Party elected Hoxha form
 ally as First Secretary.\n\nIt was in this position as First Secretary tha
 t Hoxha became head of state after the Albanian monarchy was abolished in 
 1946.\n\nIn the years after Stalin's death\, Hoxha grew increasingly distr
 essed by the policies of the Soviet leadership and of Khrushchev in partic
 ular. China was also disillusioned with Soviet behavior at this time\, and
  Hoxha found common ground with Mao Zedong's criticisms of Moscow. By 1961
 \, Hoxha's attacks on the "revisionist" Soviet leadership had so infuriate
 d Khrushchev that he elected first to terminate Moscow's economic aid to A
 lbania and ultimately to sever diplomatic relations entirely.\n\nUnder Hox
 ha's leadership\, the Albanian literacy rate improved from 5-10% in rural 
 areas to more 90%. Hoxha was also a proponent of women's rights\, stating 
 "the entire party and country should hurl into the fire and break the neck
  of anyone who dared trample underfoot the sacred edict of the party on th
 e defense of women's rights". Accordingly\, more than 175 times as many wo
 men attended secondary schools in 1978 than had done so in 1938.\n\nCritic
 s of Hoxha point out that his reign had state repression of dissidents rem
 iniscent of the Soviet Union and what they perceived as a paranoid persona
 lity cult. The 1992 book "Albania: A Country Study"\, commissioned by the 
 U.S. government\, alleged that one out of three Albanians had either been 
 interrogated by the Sigurimi secret police or incarcerated in labor camps.
 \n\nHoxha died in 1985\, leading Ramiz Alia to succeed him as head of stat
 e. Although Albania was one of the poorest European nations at the time of
  his death\, the country was also economically self-sufficient\, carrying 
 minimal foreign debt and boasting a trade surplus of $10 million.\n\n"Ever
 y departure from class struggle has fatal results for the destiny of socia
 lism."\n\n- Enver Hoxha

 and before the pyramids\, for example. Only seldom does the thought occur 
 to them what enslavement\, what lowering of human self-esteem was connecte

 \, Lenin excoriated Kautsky's interpretations of Marxist thought stating "
 Kautsky has beaten the world record in the liberal distortion of Marx." (s
 ee Lenin's essay "How Kautsky Turned Marx Into A Common Liberal").\n\nKaut

  one of his eyes was reportedly presented to Haydée as a form of intimida

 n\, a founding member of the Black Panther Party. "The people have now com
 e to realize that the only way to deal with the oppressor is to deal on ou

 . Through the AAA group\, Seale met Huey Newton.\n\nIn an interview record

 ounding of the BPP in his own words:\n\n"Black Panther Party\, 1966\, when
  Huey and I founded that organization\, that particular year\, numerous ac
 ts of police brutality had sparked a lot of spontaneous riots\, something 
 that Huey and I were against\, the spontaneous riots.\n\n...\n\nAnd we sit
  down and began to write out this Ten-Point Platform and Program in the No

  the community where Huey and I lived. And we wrote out this program.\n\n'
 We want power to determine our own destiny in our own Black community'\, a
 lluding to the needs to be organized-political electoral power. Full emplo
 yment\, decent housing\, decent education that taught us about our true se
 lves\, not to have to fight in Vietnam\, immediate end to police brutality
  and murder of back people was point number seven.\n\nThe right to have ju
 ries of our peers in the courts\, what have you. We summed it up. We wante
 d land\, bread\, housing\, education\, clothing\, justice\, and peace. And
 \, in the tail end\, we stuck in two famous paragraphs: 'When in the cours
 e of human events it becomes necessary for one people to separate themself
  from the political bondage' - that was the emphasis\, the political bonda
 ge - 'which have connected them with another\, and to assume among the pow
 ers of the Earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of natur
 e and nature's God entitled them.'\n\nI mean\, this was the kind of summar
 ization we gave to our meaning. And we summarized that Ten-Point Platform 
 Program\, flipped a coin to see who would be chairman. I won chairman and 
 we created the Black Panther Party."\n\nBobby Seale was also one of the or
 iginal "Chicago Eight" defendants charged with conspiracy and inciting a r
 iot in the wake of protests during the 1968 Democratic National Convention
  in Chicago.\n\nDuring the trial\, Seale\, the only black member of the Ch
 icago Eight\, was repeatedly bound and gagged. Although he was ultimately 
 not convicted\, Seale was sentenced to four years in prison for contempt o
 f court.\n\nIn 1973\, Seale ran for Mayor of Oakland\, California. He rece
 ived the second-most votes in a field of nine candidates\, but ultimately 
 lost in a run-off with incumbent Mayor John Reading.\n\nAmong Seale's work

 or the USSR\, which defeated the insurgents\, communists and anti-communis
 ts alike\, with military force.
DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1956\, a rebellion broke out in Budapest agains
 t the Soviet-aligned Hungarian People's Republic. The uprising was the fir
 st major threat to Soviet control since the Red Army drove Nazi Germany fr
 om its territory at the End of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe revolt began
  as a student protest\, which attracted thousands as they marched through 
 central Budapest to the Hungarian Parliament building. Protesters were fir
 ed upon from within the building by the State Security Police\, killing mu
 ltiple students.\n\nAs news of the violence spread\, disorder and violence
  erupted throughout the capital\, including the lynching of communist orga
 nizers and release and arming of anti-communist political prisoners.\n\nAs
  the rebellion grew\, the government quickly collapsed. Thousands of peopl
 e organized militias\, battling state police and Soviet troops. Insurgents
  took control of workers' councils from the ruling Hungarian Working Peopl
 e's Party and demanded political reforms.\n\nOn November 4th\, a large Sov
 iet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. The Soviet go
 vernment justified the suppression by taking the position that the uprisin
 g was fascist in character\, although this claim has been disputed by hist
 orians such as Peter Fryer\, author of "Hungarian Tragedy" and eyewitness 
 to the uprising.\n\nOver 2\,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were kill
 ed in the conflict\, and 200\,000 Hungarians fled as refugees. Mass arrest
 s and denunciations continued for months thereafter\, and suppression of t
 he revolution continued for decades afterward.\n\nThese Soviet actions\, w
 hile strengthening control over the Eastern Bloc\, alienated many Western 
 Marxists\, leading to splits and/or considerable losses of membership for 
 communist parties in capitalist states.\n\nImre Nagy\, a communist politic
 al leader during the crisis who embraced some of the insurgent's proposed 
 reforms\, was secretly captured\, convicted of organizing the overthrow of
  the Hungarian People's Republic\, and executed.\n\nIn 1989\, Nagy was pol
 itically rehabilitated and re-buried. Approximately 200\,000 people attend
 ed the ceremony\, one of the events that marked an end to communism in Hun
 gary. At the inauguration of the Third Hungarian Republic in 1989\, Octobe
 r 23rd was declared a national holiday.\n\nThe uprising is celebrated by r
 ight-wing forces today\; in 2006\, President Bush sent George Pataki\, the
  governor of New York\, to Budapest to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of
  the Hungarian Revolution.

 had much in common with the state-centered capitalism of the West as well 
 as fascism.\n\n"This distinction between head and body\, between intellect

 's organisation is only a replica of bourgeois society. His revolution is 
 objectively determined by the forces that create a social order incorporat

 here was no evidence these students were in danger and that\, in the same 
 period\, Reagan's administration was actively supporting the government of
  El Salvador\, which had already killed American citizens.\n\nThe invasion
  drew widespread condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly voted 1
 08 to 9 in condemning the act as "a flagrant violation of international la

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1977\, a district team of officers raided Houns
 low hospital in West London\, cutting phone lines and removing patients fr
 om the facility. Workers had been occupying the facility since March to pr
 event its closure.\n\nHounslow Hospital was a small facility for geriatric
  and long-stay patients in an industrial area. The hospital was considered
  a home as well as a place for treatment. \n\nHounslow's closure was annou
 nced by the state in January 1977 and scheduled for August. A hospital sta
 ff occupation started as a "work-in" in March\, intent on exploiting a leg
 al loophole where\, if the hospital has patients\, the law mandates the ho
 spital be funded.\n\nManagement tried to transfer staff\, and threatened t
 hose who refused with sanctions and firing. The threats did not succeed\, 
 and the work-in continued beyond the scheduled closing date.\n\nOn this da
 y in 1977\, a district team of officers raided Hounslow hospital to evict 
 occupying workers\, cutting phone lines and removing patients from the fac
 ility. Beds and furniture were wrecked\, the floor strewn with food\, torn
  mattresses\, sheets\, and personal articles.\n\nIn this manner\, the hosp
 ital was closed by force. The raid provoked a public outcry and led direct
 ly a year-long occupation of the closed hospital. 2000 striking hospital w
 orkers picketed the Ealing\, Hammersmith\, and Hounslow Area Health Author
 ity (AHA) to protest the raid and demand that the hospital be reopened. Wh
 en the occupation ended\, work began on redesigning the facilities into a 
 new community hospital/health center.

 as freed on August 5th\, 1970.\n\nHuey Newton was a revolutionary activist
  who\, along with fellow Merritt College student Bobby Seale\, co-founded 
 the Black Panther Party (BPP). In the 1960s\, under their leadership\, the
  BPP founded over 60 community support programs\, including food banks\, f
 ree medical clinics\, legal advice seminars\, clothing banks\, housing co-
 ops\, and their own ambulance service.\n\nOn October 28th\, 1967\, Newton 
 was wounded in a shootout with police. The incident occurred after he was 
 pulled over by Oakland cop John Frey\, who called for backup after realizi
 ng who Newton was. When a second officer arrived\, shots rang out\; Frey w
 as killed\, while Newton and the other officer were wounded.\n\nThe "Free 
 Huey!" campaign began in December\, the phrase originating out a coalition
  between the BPP and the Peace and Freedom Party. The trial\, which began 
 on July 15th\, 1968\, quickly ascended beyond the scope of Newton himself.
 \n\nNewton was initially convicted of voluntary manslaughter in September 
 1968. In May 1970\, the California Appellate Court reversed the conviction
  and ordered a new trial. The charges were finally dismissed by the Alamed
 a County Superior Court\, and Huey was freed on August 5th\, 1970.\n\n"If

 e\, working in factories and mills as a teenager and witnessing labor stri
 fe firsthand. He was greatly inspired by Emma Goldman\, and met her briefl
 y after a lecture she gave in Cleveland. Czolgosz's direct inspiration to 
 assassinate a national leader possibly came from the assassination of King
  Umberto I of Italy by anarchist Gaetano Bresci in 1900.\n\nOn September 6
 th\, 1901\, Czolgosz shot President William McKinley on the grounds of the
  Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo\, New York. McKinley died eight days l
 ater of gangrene caused by the wounds and was succeeded by Theodore Roosev
 elt in office.\n\nCzolgosz was tried and found guilty just over a month la
 ter. Before his execution\, Czolgosz explained "I killed the President bec
 ause he was the enemy of the good people - the good working people...I am 
 not sorry for my crime".\n\nIn the aftermath of the assassination\, there 
 was a series of strong reprisals against the anarchist movement. Several a
 narchists\, including Emma Goldman\, were arrested on suspicion of involve
 ment in the attack\, and vigilantes attacked anarchist colonies and newspa
 pers.\n\nFear of the movement also led to government creating anarchist su
 rveillance programs\, which were eventually consolidated on a federal leve

 ing to be paid in cash\, not scrip (currency only usable at company stores
 ) and to be allowed to check the weight of their haul (they were paid by w
 eight\, but not allowed to check the company's measurement).\n\nWorkers in

 urrounded the stockades where leased convicts were held and sent them by t

 tockades to the ground and freed hundreds of convicts being held there. On
  Nov. 2nd\, another band attacked stockades in a different location and fr

 nvicts were set free.\n\nThe strike was forcibly put down by state militia
 \, ending with the arrest of hundreds of miners. All but one were either a
 cquitted or merely fined. Tennessee ended its policy of leasing convict la
 bor\, using convicts to work in state-owned mines instead.

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1995\, workers at the JJ Fast Food Distribution
  plant in Tottenham\, London walked out to demand the reinstatement of the
 ir elected shop steward\, beginning a several-month strike at the factory.
 \n\nThe workers were mostly Kurdish and Turkish immigrants\, as the food a
 nd textile industries were significant employers of immigrant workers.\n\n
 Working conditions at the plant were difficult - according to the anarchis
 t publication Black Flag\, workers were putting in 60-70 hours per week wi
 th no overtime\, sick\, or holiday pay. The day before the strike\, the fa
 ctory manager had fired the elected shop steward in response workers' atte
 mpts to organize through the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU).\
 n\nWhen arriving to work the next day\, workers refused to work\, demandin
 g the reinstatement of their elected representative. The boss then demande
 d union workers leave\, and then fighting broke out. The union members the
 n gathered outside the gate and were attacked by police.\n\nThe following 
 day\, the sacked workers and around 100 supporters again gathered outside 
 the warehouse\, attempting to block the access road and again clashing wit
 h police. The labor disputes continued for months. After two weeks\, an In
 dustrial Tribunal initiated by TGWU ruled that the workers had been sacked
  for union membership\, and ordered them to return to work February 26th.\
 n\nDespite this apparent victory\, when 35 workers returned to their jobs\
 , they were told that their union would not be recognized and that they be
  forced to work from 5 AM until midnight. This caused another strike\, how
 ever it was short-lived and ineffective. Only 12 out of the original 42 fi
 red JJ workers returned to work on March 18th.

  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi being assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards\, 
 who had killed her in retaliation for military attacks on the Harmandir Sa

 articularly sadistic: perpetrators carried iron rods\, knives\, clubs\, an
 d combustible material to burn Sikhs alive. Mobs entered Sikh neighborhood
 s\, killing Sikhs indiscriminately and destroying shops and houses.\n\nArm
 ed crowds stopped busses and trains in and near Delhi\, pulling off Sikh p
 assengers and burning them alive. Others were dragged from their homes and
  hacked to death while women were sexually assaulted. Acid attacks also to
 ok place.\n\nIn 2011\, Human Rights Watch claimed that the Indian governme
 nt had "yet to prosecute those responsible for the mass killings"\, and do
 cuments exposed by Wikileaks indicate that the U.S. government was convinc
 ed of Indian National Congress' complicity in the violence. As recently as
  2011\, new mass graves were discovered in Haryana.

 Palmer\, the same individual behind the infamous Palmer Raids\, declared t

 it a crime to interfere with the production or transportation of necessiti

 erican Federation of Labor (AFL) founder Samuel Gompers had been promised 
 by President Woodrow Wilson that the Lever Act would not be used to suppre

 operators made false charges that Lenin and Trotsky had ordered the strike
  and were financing it\, and some of the press repeated those claims. Othe
 rs used words like "insurrection" and "Bolshevik revolution". Because of t
 his propaganda and the Attorney General's injunction against the strike\, 
 the UMW called the strike off on November 8th.\n\nMany workers ignored thi
 s order\, however\, and the strike continued for over a month\, with a fin
 al agreement being reached on December 10th. Workers won a 14% wage increa

 ccording to Professor Robin D.G. Kelley\, "[Robinson's] monumental Black M

 o task for failing to comprehend radical movements outside of Europe. He r
 ewrites the history of the West from ancient times to the mid-twentieth ce

 versally applied outside of Europe. Instead he characterized black rebelli
 ons as expressions of what he called the 'Black Radical Tradition'\, movem
 ents whose objectives and aspirations confounded Western social analysis. 
 Marxism also failed to account for the racial character of capitalism."\n\
 nIn a critical review of the work\, authors William I. Robinson\, Salvador
  Rangel and Hilbourne A. Watson state "Black Marxism has become a favored 
 text with which to badger radical intellectuals and activists who place a 
 premium on proletarian struggle. This has led some among left organizers t
 o fear they may be condemned as Eurocentric\, as 'class reductionists'\, a
 nd as 'ignoring race' should they place a premium on class analysis\, shou
 ld they insist that racism is an outcome of class exploitation\, and that 
 its eradication involves a transnational and pan-ethnic proletarian strugg
 le against capitalism...At a time when global capital is on an all-out ram
 page against the global working and popular classes and when our very surv
 ival is under threat\, we need more than ever a transnational revolutionar
 y proletarian politics. We won’t find that in Black Marxism."\n\n"Racism
 \, I maintain\, was not simply a convention for ordering the relations of 
 European to non-European peoples but has its genesis in the 'internal' rel
 ations of European peoples."\n\n- Cedric Robinson

 the Provisional government located in Petrograd\, then capital of Russia\,
  had been captured.\n\nElections were held on November 12th. In contrast t
 o their majority in the soviets (local council governments)\, the Bolshevi

 behind the Socialist Revolutionary Party\, which won 370 seats.\n\nOn its 
 first and only day in session\, the Constituent Assembly came into conflic
 t with the soviets\, and it rejected soviet decrees on peace and land\, re

 anuary.\n\nThe political situation devolved into a civil war between the B
 olsheviks\, Whites (counter-revolutionaries)\, Makhnovists\, independence 
 movements\, and other socialist factions.\n\nThe Bolsheviks eventually def
 eated all rival parties and formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
  (USSR) in 1922. Their victory marked the beginning of Marxism-Leninism as
  a global force.

 the day is: how to bring about a revolution of the heart\, a revolution wh
 ich has to start with each one of us?"\n\nThe Catholic Worker movement\, f

 of the first issue of the Catholic Worker on May 1st\, 1933.\n\nThe paper 
 was priced at one cent\, and published continuously since then. It was aim
 ed at those suffering the most in the depths of the Great Depression\, "th
 ose who think there is no hope for the future"\, and announced to them tha
 t "the Catholic Church has a social program...there are men of God who are
  working not only for their spiritual but for their material welfare." It 
 accepted no advertising and did not pay its staff.\n\nLike many newspapers
  of the day\, including those for which Day had already been writing\, the
  Catholic Worker was an unapologetic example of advocacy journalism. It pr
 ovided coverage of strikes\, explored working conditions\, especially of w
 omen and black workers\, and explicated papal teaching on social issues.\n
 \nIts viewpoint was partisan and stories were designed to move its readers
  to take action locally\, for example\, by patronizing laundries recommend
 ed by the Laundry Workers' Union. Its advocacy of federal child labor laws
  put it at odds with the American Church hierarchy from its first issue.\n
 \nDay's activism continued throughout the rest of her life\, resulting in 
 multiple arrests. In the summer of 1973\, she joined César Chávez in his
  campaign for farm laborers in the fields of California. She was also arre
 sted at the age of 75 for defying a ban on picketing\, spending ten days i
 n jail.\n\n"The Gospel takes away our right forever\, to discriminate betw

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1988\, a conflict between soldiers and metallur
 gists on strike at Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (CSN) in Rio de Janeiro
 \, Brazil led to the deaths of three workers\, with at least thirty-one mo
 re injured.\n\nAccording to author Andrew Costa\, the city of Volta Redond
 a was engaged in a general strike for the implementation of a six-hour shi
 ft and the reinstatement of workers dismissed in an earlier 1987 strike. W
 omen in the local neighborhoods prevented CSN vans from picking up their h
 usbands to work with pickets on the street\, and the Residents Association
 s carried out barricades so that CSN busses and other transport could not 
 run while the company was refusing to negotiate with workers.\n\nThe confl
 ict on November 9th began when about 600 state soldiers descended on Aveni
 da Independência\, in front of CSN\, throwing tear gas bombs at a crowd o
 f workers. The crowd responded with by attacking sticks and stones. Three 
 people were killed\, and thirty-one were wounded. A monument dedicated to 
 the victims of the violence was later partially destroyed with bombs.\n\nI
 n spite of this violence\, workers eventually prevailed\, winning their ri
 ght to six-hour shifts.

 and abolishing the constitution. Vargas announced a new state - the "Estad

 effectively giving himself autocratic powers.\n\nThe coup took place a few
  months before the end of Vargas's legal term in office and impending elec

 nt\, known as the "Cohen Plan"\, was also circulated through the media\, a
 lthough Vargas himself didn't acknowledge it.\n\nThe new government greatl
 y expanded the power of police\, persecuted political dissidents\, de fact
 o banned union activity\, and allowed Vargas to rule for the next eight ye
 ars under what amounted to martial law. Vargas was eventually deposed by t
 he military in a coup launched from his own War Ministry on October 29th\,
  1945\, after the conclusion of World War II.

 y general strike in which 250\,000 struck for a variety of social reforms\
 , including a 48 hour week\, women's suffrage\, disability insurance\, and
  the formation of people's army.\n\nThe strike took place in the context o
 f World War I and skyrocketing food prices that left many workers hungry. 
 As bread prices doubled between 1914 and 1918\, the average industrial wag
 es sank by a quarter. The wage of conscripted soldiers was also often less
  the jobs those workers were forced to abandon.\n\nIn early November\, Zur
 ich's labor movement sought to celebrate the first anniversary of the Russ
 ian October Revolution. After news of the German November Revolution and t
 he toppling of the German emperor reached Zurich\, the military banned all
  public demonstrations\, dispersing one protest by attacking workers with 
 saber-bearing cavalry.\n\nFollowing this incident\, leaders of the Swiss S
 ocialist Party (SPS)\, the country's labor unions\, and the socialist pres
 s\, banded together in an alliance called the Olten Action Committee (OAK)
 \, issued a proclamation of working class demands and a call for a general
  strike on November 12th\, 1918.\n\nThe demands included a 48 hour week\, 
 women's suffrage\, disability insurance\, establishing a state monopoly on
  foreign trade\, new national council elections\, and the reorganization o
 f the military into a people's army.\n\nFacing pressure from the governmen
 t to end the strike and a hostile military\, OAK leadership quickly backpe
 daled and called off the strike just two days later\, on November 14th. De
 spite this\, some workers continued to strike for several days afterward.\
 n\nA military court acted quickly and initiated legal proceedings against 
 35\,000 strikers\, and 21 of its leaders were tried for mutiny. In the sho
 rt term\, the strike's failure was a disaster for the labor movement\, how
 ever many of OAK's demands would later come to fruition - in 1919\, the 48
  hour week was established for workers.

COMMENT:Karen Silkwood was an American chemical technician and labor union
  activist who was possibly assassinated via car crash on this day in 1974\
 , while en route to meet with a NYT journalist and union official.
DESCRIPTION:Karen Gay Silkwood (1946 - 1974) was an American chemical tech
 nician and labor union activist who was possibly assassinated on this day 
 in 1974. Silkwood is most known for raising concerns about corporate pract
 ices related to health and safety in the Kerr-McGee Cimarron Fuel Fabricat
 ion Site in Oklahoma.\n\nAs an employee of Kerr-Mcgee\, Silkwood made plut
 onium pellets and was the first woman on the union's negotiating team. Aft
 er investigating her workplace\, she found several health code violations 
 and later testified to the Atomic Energy Commission about her concerns for
  the handling of radioactive materials at work. Shortly before her death\,
  Silkwood's body contained 400 times the legal limit of plutonium.\n\nOn t
 his day in 1974\, while en route to meet a New York Times journalist and u
 nion official\, Silkwood died in a crash where her car ran off the road. S
 he had just left a union meeting at the Hub cafe in Crescent and was seen 
 with a binder full of documents. None of the documents were found at the s
 cene of the crash.\n\nAlthough foul play was not conclusively proven\, ski
 d marks from Silkwood's car were present on the road\, suggesting that she
  was trying to get back onto the road after being pushed from behind. Inve
 stigators also noted damage on the rear of Silkwood's vehicle that was not
  present before the accident\, and microscopic examination of the rear of 
 Silkwood's car showed paint chips that could have come only from a rear im
 pact by another vehicle.\n\nSilkwood's family sued Kerr-McGee on grounds o
 f negligence\, and Kerr-McGee eventually settled out of court for $1.38 mi
 llion\, admitting no liability. Kerr-McGee closed its nuclear fuel plants 
 in 1975.

 ult of the conference\, which continued into 1885\, a "General Act" was si

  being the sole exception. The Act's main features were the establishment 
 of a regime of free trade stretching across the middle of Africa\, the dev

 he principle of "effective occupation".\n\nThe Conference's rapacious inte

 Leon described the conference as "an event unique in the history of politi
 cal science...Diplomatic in form\, it was economic in fact."\n\nBefore the
  Conference ended\, the Lagos Observer declared that "the world had\, perh

 ayed a leading role in the Loray Mill Strike of 1929 and a former communis
 t who renounced his beliefs upon his exile to Soviet Russia. He died on th

 r organizer\, who\, along with six Loray Mill workers\, were indicted for 
 the murder of a police chief that happened during the protests. Beal was c
 onvicted and skipped bail\, fleeing to the Soviet Union. There\, he became
  ambivalent about the state of the Bolshevik revolution and sought to retu
 rn to the United States.\n\nAfter successfully fleeing to his home country
 \, Beal changed his mind once more\, returning to the Soviet Union and wor
 king as a manager in a Ukrainian tractor factory. It was here that he beca
 me disillusioned for good with the communist system\, noting bitterly that
  he was still a labor organizer\, facing Soviet versions of the same issue
 s that had prompted the North Carolinians to strike\, only now he was urgi
 ng workers not to demand better conditions.\n\nUpon returning to the U.S.\
 , he became an anti-communist critic\, publishing his experiences in a boo
 k titled "Proletarian Journey". According to author Matthew Disler\, much 
 of "Proletarian Journey" is clearly embellished\, repeating dialogues from
  decades earlier\, frequently editorializing\, and mixing anecdotes from h
 is experiences with diatribes about his enemies within the Communist movem
 ent. Bisler also claims that these inconsistencies are even worse in Beal'
 s 1949 book\, "The Red Fraud".\n\nAfter serving four years in prison\, Bea
 l was paroled and began working at a textile mill\, participating in union
  activities there. He died on November 15th\, 1954 of a heart attack.

 but grew more ambitious as the strike war on (the creation of an artificia

  city-wide on November 13th\, and the Ecuadorian government called on the 
 military to suppress it. On November 15th\, 1922\, more than 20\,000 demon
 strators gathered in downtown Guayaquil and marched towards the police sta
 tion. When they arrived\, they were fired upon by soldiers at the station.
  Approximately three hundred protesters died\, either by gunshot or from b
 eing stabbed by bayonets.\n\nFor most workers\, this incident was the end 
 of the strike\, however many of their demands\, including an exchange rate
  moratorium and wage increases for trolley workers\, were conceded.

 class French woman who was executed in 1943 for providing abortions during
  the reign of the Nazi Vichy Regime. In 1988\, a film based on her life wa
 s released - "Story of Women".\n\nGiraud was born into a poor family in 19
 03 and settled in the port city of Cherbourg. She cleaned houses and worke
 d as a laundress to support her family.\n\nIn 1939\, the French government
  increased the criminal penalties for abortion\, as World War II had cause
 d a significant decline in the birth rate. Along these lines\, the Vichy R
 egime (formed in 1940) created propaganda posters stating "The Family is t
 he Foundation of Society".\n\nWhen the Nazis occupied Cherbourg in June 19
 40\, there was an influx of prostitutes to the area and Giraud rented room
 s out to them. She performed abortions on 27 women\, including one who die
 d in January 1942. An anonymous letter detailing Giraud's activities writt
 en in October 1942 led to her arrest.\n\nSuch was the prominence of Giraud
 's trial that the head of the Vichy Regime\, Philippe Pétain\, called her
  an immoral woman himself. She was guillotined on July 30th\, 1943\, the l
 ast woman to be executed by the Nazi French government.\n\nGiraud's story 
 was dramatized in the 1988 film Story of Women\, directed by Claude Chabro
 l. The film premiered at the 45th Venice International Film Festival\, in 
 which Isabelle Huppert was awarded the prize for best actress.

DESCRIPTION:Sammy Younge Jr.\, born on this day in 1944\, was an activist 
 who was shot dead after he attempted to use a "whites only" restroom in Tu
 skegee\, Alabama. Younge was one of the first black college students kille
 d in the civil rights movement. After his murderer's acquittal by an all-w

 in opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nYounge served in the U.S. Navy for tw
 o years before being medically discharged\, after which he began attending
  the Tuskegee Institute as a political science student.\n\nYounge became a
  civil rights activist after enrolling in college\, becoming active within
  the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and a leader with th
 e Tuskegee Institute Advancement League. He also participated in the Selma
  to Montgomery protest march in March 1965.\n\nIn September 1965\, Younge 
 was arrested and jailed after attempting to drive a group of black people 
 to get registered to vote in Lee County\, Alabama. Younge continued his ef
 forts to get blacks registered to vote in Macon County\, Alabama four mont
 hs after being released from jail\, up until his death.\n\nOn January 3rd\
 , 1966\, Younge was shot and killed by a gas station clerk after trying to
  use a "whites only" bathroom in his hometown of Tuskegee. Earlier that da
 y\, Younge had brought 40 people to register to vote at Macon County Court
 house\, where he was threatened with a knife by a registrar.\n\nAt 21 year
 s of age\, Younge became the first black university student to be killed i
 n the civil rights movement. His murderer was quickly arrested\, indicted\
 , and found not guilty by an all-white jury. This led to widespread protes
 ts in Tuskegee\, and for the SNCC to officially oppose the Vietnam War. Th
 e SNCC issued a statement on January 6th\, 1966\, saying:\n\n"We believe t
 he United States government has been deceptive in its claims of concern fo
 r the freedom of the Vietnamese people\, just as the government has been d
 eceptive in claiming concern for the freedom of colored people in such oth
 er countries as the Dominican Republic\, the Congo\, South Africa\, Rhodes
 ia\, and in the United States itself.\n\n...The murder of Samuel [Younge] 
 in Tuskegee\, Alabama\, is no different than the murder of peasants in Vie
 tnam\, for both [Younge] and the Vietnamese sought\, and are seeking\, to 
 secure the rights guaranteed them by law. In each case the United States g
 overnment bears a great part of the responsibility for these deaths. Samue
 l [Younge] was murdered because United States law is not being enforced. V
 ietnamese are murdered because the United States is pursuing an aggressive
  policy in violation of international law."

DESCRIPTION:On this day in 1909\, President William Howard Taft sent U.S. 
 warships to take position against the elected government of Nicaraguan Pre
 sident José Santos Zelaya. Taft's administration had close relations with
  U.S. corporations operating in Nicaragua. Those corporations were opposed
  to the way Zelaya defended the economic interests of his country and the 
 region from exploitation by U.S. businesses.\n\nThe U.S. moved to remove P
 resident Zelaya after he executed two American citizens who had conspired 
 to commit a revolution against the government. Despite the fact that Zelay
 a proposed a commission made up of Mexicans and Americans come to Nicaragu
 a to investigate the executions\, promising to resign if it found him guil
 ty of any wrongdoing\, President Taft ordered warships to approach both Ni
 caraguan coasts and marines to assemble in Panama.\n\nZelaya fled the coun
 try\, stating that he would "give no pretext" to American hostilities. His
  successor José Madríz was eventually forced to resign by the American f
 orces\, and followed Zelaya into exile. Historian Stephen Kinzer has writt
 en the following about the event:\n\n"This was the first time the United S
 tates government had explicitly orchestrated the overthrow of a foreign le
 ader. In Hawaii\, an American diplomat had managed the revolution\, but wi
 thout specific instructions from Washington. In Cuba\, Puerto Rico\, and t
 he Philippines\, American 'regime change' operations were part of a larger
  war. The overthrow of President Zelaya in Nicaragua was the first real Am

  "Uncle Tom's Cabin" on Weld's text\, and it is regarded as second only to
  that work in its influence on the anti-slavery movement.\n\nWeld married 
 fellow abolitionist lecturer Angelina Grimké\, Sarah\, at the home of her
  sister in Philadelphia and explicitly rejected the legal power of husband
  over wife.\n\nTheir wedding was the opening event in a week-long abolitio

 of mob violence\, Philadelphia abolitionists had raised $40\,000 to build 
 their own (in Weld's words) "Temple of Freedom." Just four days after the 
 building opened\, a mob burned it to the ground.\n\nWeld continued his abo

 .C. to help anti-slavery efforts there. In 1848\, Theodore\, Angelina\, an
 d Sarah also started a progressive\, racially integrated school in Bellevi

 by white paramilitary forces of the unionizing efforts of 10\,000 black su

 there was a narrow window of time to harvest the cane and the planters wou
 ld be unlikely to find strikebreakers.\n\nJudge Taylor Beattie\, an ex-Con
 federate soldier and slaveowner\, declared martial law and gathered up hun
 dreds of white men to form a paramilitary group to suppress the strikers\,
  close the borders to the city\, and monitor all movement of black people 
 in the area. Not wanting to be boxed in\, black strikers fired on the city
  border guards. In retaliation\, the paramilitary forces initiated three d
 ays of violence against mostly unarmed black workers and their families.\n
 \nEstimates of the total number of dead range from 35-60\, making it one o
 f the deadliest strikes in American labor history. Despite the women and c
 hildren killed\, the Southern press heralded the white perpetrators of the
  violence.\n\nOne participant\, Andrew Price\, went on to be elected to Co
 ngress. Black farmworkers in the region did not make another large effort 
 to unionize until the 1940s.

  solidarity with farmers protesting en masse and to demand better working 
 conditions for themselves.\n\nThe strike took place following months of pr

 ts would leave small farmers\, the vast majority\, at the mercy of large c
 orporations. Poor farmers were already desperate before the laws were pass
 ed - in 2019 alone\, 10\,281 agricultural workers committed suicide.\n\nDo
 zens of farm unions began organizing protests demanding the repeal of thes
 e laws. After failing to get the support of their respective state governm
 ents\, the farmers decided to pressure the Central Government by marching 
 to Delhi en masse.\n\nThe farmers arrived at Delhi on November 25th\, 2020
  and were met by police\, who employed the use of tear gas and water canno
 ns\, dug up roads\, and used layers of barricades and sand barriers to try
  and stop their march.\n\nOn November 26th\, 250 million workers from all 
 over the country initiated a general strike in solidarity with the farmer'
 s struggle. According to Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research\, t
 rade unions issued a twelve-point charter of demands which included "the r
 eversal of the anti-worker\, anti-farmer laws pushed by the government in 
 September\, the reversal of the privatisation of major government enterpri
 ses\, and immediate [Covid] relief for the population".\n\nFarmer protests
  continued for more than a year\, featuring mass marches\, clashes with po
 lice\, and many failed negotiations between farmers' unions and the govern
 ment. Rakesh Tikait\, a leader with Bharatiya Kisan Union (English: Indian
  Farmers' Union) stated in October 2021 that approximately 750 participant
 s have died in the protest.\n\nAmong the dead was a Senior Superintendent 
 of Police in the city of Sonepat\, who committed suicide\, saying he could
  not bear the pain of the farmers. His suicide note read "Bullets fired fr

 Minister Narendra Modi stated that his government would repeal the three a
 cts in the upcoming winter parliamentary session in December. The national
  spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union\, Rakesh Tikait\, stated the pr
 otests would only cease once the laws were repealed.\n\nThe film actor Dee

 officer the following: "Ye inquilab hai. This is a revolution. If you take

COMMENT:Makhnovia\, also known as the Free Territory of Ukraine\, was an a
 narchist society established on this day in 1917 with the capture of the U
 krainian city of Huliaipole. The territory lasted 3 years before being ove
 rwhelmed by the Red Army.
DESCRIPTION:Makhnovia\, also known as the Free Territory of Ukraine\, was 
 an anarchist society established on this day in 1917 with the capture of t
 he Ukrainian city of Huliaipole.\n\nThe Free Territory was an attempt to f
 orm a stateless anarchist society during the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917 
 to 1921\, during which time "free soviets" and libertarian communes operat
 ed under the protection of Nestor Makhno's Revolutionary Insurrectionary A
 rmy (flag shown above).\n\nAs Makhnovia self-organized along anarchist pri
 nciples\, references to "control" and "government" were highly contentious
 . For example\, the Makhnovists\, often cited as a form of government (wit
 h Nestor Makhno as their "leader")\, were ostensibly organized to serve in
  a purely military role\, with Makhno himself functioning as more of a str
 ategist than commander.\n\nThe economy of Makhnovia varied by region\, fro
 m "market socialism" to anarcho-communism in character. Where money was us
 ed\, production was often organized in the form of worker cooperatives.\n\
 nThe Bolsheviks were openly hostile to the Free Territory. On November 26t
 h\, 1920\, less than two weeks after the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Arm
 y assisted Bolshevik forces in defeating the White Army\, Makhno's headqua
 rters staff and many of his subordinate commanders were arrested at a Red 
 Army planning conference to which they had been invited by Moscow\, and ex
 ecuted.\n\nMakhno himself fled the region several months later\, settling 
 in Paris\, France.

DESCRIPTION:Harvey Bernard Milk (1930 - 1978) was the first openly gay ele
 cted official in the history of California\, elected to the San Francisco 
 Board of Supervisors\, and was assassinated on this day in 1978. Although 
 he achieved national renown as one of the most pro-LGBT politicians in the
  United States at the time\, politics was something Milk came to later in 
 life\, after his experiences with the counterculture movement of the 1960s
 .\n\nIn 1972\, Milk moved from New York City to the Castro District of San
  Francisco and took advantage of the growing political and economic power 
 of the neighborhood to promote his activism. Milk unsuccessfully ran for o
 ffice three times\, but finally won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977.\n
 \nMilk was assassinated on this day in 1978\, after only eleven months in 
 office. He was killed by Dan White\, a disgruntled former city supervisor.
 \n\nDuring Milk's short time in office\, he sponsored a bill banning discr
 imination in public accommodations\, housing\, and employment on the basis
  of sexual orientation. After his death\, Milk became an icon in San Franc
 isco and a martyr for the gay community.\n\nIn 2021\, the U.S. Navy launch
 ed a ship named after Harvey Milk\, who had been discharged from the Navy 
 during the Korean War after being questioned about his sexual orientation.
