        "description": "On this day in 1959, U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista fled the country following the victory of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement (M-26-7) at the Battle of Santa Clara, marking the successful conclusion of the Cuban Revolution.\n\nThe 26th of July Movement takes its name from the date of with a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953, however, the movement bearing this name was not formally organized until the attackers were released from prison in 1955. Public resistance continued sporadically until November 1956, when 80 members of the M-26-7 returned from exile.\n\nSoon after landing on the island, a separate revolutionary group, the \"Directorio Revoluncionari Estudiantil\" (DRE), unsuccessfully attempted an attack on the Presidential Palace in Havana.\n\nThroughout 1957, armed resistance from groups such as the DRE and M-26-7 would escalate. After a failed offensive by the government against rebels in the summer of 1958, the rebels launched a major counter-offensive.\n\nOn December 28th, 1958, after a fraudulent election in favor of Batista, revolutionary forces reached the city of Santa Clara. Seizing equipment from an armored train intended to transport government reinforcements, the rebels quickly captured the city, prompting Batista to panic and flee to the Dominican Republic with a personal fortune of more than $300 million.\n\nIn the following days, revolutionary forces entered Havana with no resistance, and Castro established a provisional government. The 26th of July Movement later reformed along Marxist\u2013Leninist lines, becoming the Communist Party of Cuba in October 1965.\n\nBatista later settled in fascist Spain, dying there in 1973 at the age of 72.",

More than 200,000 Haitians died in the struggle for liberation.\n\nThe Haitian Revolution was the only uprising of enslaved people that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery, and ruled by non-whites and former captives.\n\nThe revolt began on August 21st, 1791, in what was then the French colony of Saint-Domingue. Thousands of people began to kill their masters, plunge the colony into civil war.\n\nWithin the next ten days, slaves had taken control of the entire Northern Province in an uprising of unprecedented scale. The fighting was particularly brutal, and more than 200,000 black people died in the years between the initial uprising and formal independence.\n\nAlthough Toussaint Louverture established himself as a military leader of the revolution by 1801, he died shortly before independence was won. Jean-Jacques Dessalines, his former lieutenant, became the first leader of Haiti.",

In 1961, Lee was assassinated by a state representative. Lee was a charter member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Amite County and had sought to enfranchise black Americans by encouraging voter registration.\n\nIn 1961, Lee assisted Bob Moses, a field secretary with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), in his efforts to persuade locals to register. His activities were met with threats of reprisal by the white community, and Lee became one of the movement's earliest victims to white violence. On September 25th, 1961, Lee was murdered by Mississippi state representative E. H. Hurst (1908 - 1990) in broad daylight at the cotton gin while delivering cotton near Liberty.\n\nHurst killed Lee with a single shot to the head, but later claimed in court that he was defending himself after Lee attacked him with a tire iron. An all-white jury ruled that the killing was a justifiable homicide. In 1964, civil rights activist Louis Allen was killed after he informed federal investigators that his testimony in the case had been coerced on threat of violence.",

Mitchell Palmer, with more than 3,000 arrested. Though 556 people were deported, including prominent anti-capitalist thinkers like Emma Goldman, Palmer's efforts were largely frustrated by officials at the U.S. Department of Labor, which had authority for deportations and objected to DOJ methods.\n\nAlthough the DOJ initially claimed to have taken possession of several bombs, no evidence of the bombs was produced.

He regarded these as a new form of organization capable of overcoming the limitations of the old institutions of the labor movement, the trade unions and social democratic parties.\n\nPannekoek was a sharp critic of anarchism, social democracy, and Leninism. During the early years of the Russian revolution, Pannekoek gave critical support to the Bolsheviks. In later analysis, however, Pannekoek argued that the Bolsheviks crippled the workers' soviets, and formed a new ruling class of their own party.\n\nUnlike other progressive thinkers of his time, Pannekoek was also highly critical of Social Darwinism, derisively calling it \"bourgeois darwinism\".\n\n\"Public ownership is a middle-class program of a modernized and disguised form of capitalism. Common ownership by the producers can be the only goal of the working class.\"\n\n- Antonie Pannekoek",

After his murderer's acquittal by an all-white jury, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) opposed the Vietnam War.\n\nYounge served in the U.S. Navy for two years before being medically discharged, after which he began attending the Tuskegee Institute as a political science student.\n\nYounge became a civil rights activist after enrolling in college, becoming active with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and a leader with the Tuskegee Institute Advancement League. He also participated in the Selma to Montgomery protest march in March 1965.\n\nIn September 1965, Younge was arrested and jailed after attempting to drive a group of black people to get registered to vote in Lee County, Alabama. Younge continued his efforts to get blacks registered to vote in Macon County, Alabama for four months after being released from jail, up until his death.\n\nOn January 3rd, 1966, Younge was shot and killed by a gas station clerk after trying to use a \"whites only\" bathroom in his hometown of Tuskegee. Earlier that day, Younge had brought 40 people to register to vote at Macon County Courthouse, where he was threatened with a knife by a registrar.\n\nAt 21 years of age, Younge became the first black university student to be killed in the civil rights movement. His murderer was quickly arrested, indicted, and found not guilty by an all-white jury. This led to widespread protests in Tuskegee and SNCC to formally come out in opposition to the Vietnam War. The SNCC issued a statement on January 6th, 1966, saying:\n\n\"We believe the United States government has been deceptive in its claims of concern for the freedom of the Vietnamese people, just as the government has been deceptive in claiming concern for the freedom of colored people in such other countries as the Dominican Republic, the Congo, South Africa, Rhodesia, and in the United States itself.\n\n...The murder of Samuel [Younge] in Tuskegee, Alabama, is no different than the murder of peasants in Vietnam, for both [Younge] and the Vietnamese sought, and are seeking, to secure the rights guaranteed them by law. In each case the United States government bears a great part of the responsibility for these deaths. Samuel [Younge] was murdered because United States law is not being enforced. Vietnamese are murdered because the United States is pursuing an aggressive policy in violation of international law.\"",

The protest quickly evolved into a general uprising, with workers burning identification cards, attacking Portuguese traders, blocking roads, and destroying company buildings.\n\nIn response, the colonial government quickly suppressed the uprising with brutal military force, initiating a bombing campaign of nearby villages that killed anywhere from 400 - 10,000 people.\n\nDespite the short-term failure of the uprising, it served as an important precursor to the Angolan Independence War, which would eventually lead to the end of colonial rule.",

The two disagreed on the \"Negro Question\"; Trotsky saw the Trotskyist Party as providing leadership to the black community in a relationship similar to the Bolsheviks and ethnic minorities in Russia, while James suggested that the self-organized struggle of African-Americans would lead to a broader radical social movement.\n\n\"When history is written as it ought to be written, it is the moderation and long patience of the masses at which men will wonder, not their ferocity.\"\n\n- CLR James",

        "description": "Dundalli, executed by the state on this day in 1855, was an Aboriginal lawman who mediated conflict between European settlers and indigenous aboriginal peoples in the area of Brisbane in South East Queensland.\n\nCharacterized by colonial authorities as a criminal, Dundalli was an indigenous leader who coordinated decade-long resistance to the process of colonization.\n\nAs tensions escalated between indigenous people and settlers around Brisbane, Dundalli's role as a tribal leader led to widespread speculation that he instigated various violent conflicts. Despite this perception, modern historians note his restraint - he had not exacted revenge for his brother's murder at the hands of a settler and rival tribe and had saved at least one settler's life in a raid.\n\nIn 1854, Dundalli entered Brisbane to be paid for removing a felled tree and was arrested by the police. Tried and convicted for murder on flimsy evidence, he was hanged a few months later on this day in 1855. Historian Libby Connors writes that, from the gallows, Dundalli gave a speech addressed to his wife and Turrbal, Ningy Ningy, and Djindubari people gathered nearby, calling on them to avenge his death.\n\nConnors states \"In the end, the theatre of his own execution and gallows speech provides further evidence that a parallel system of justice was operating in the region which the colonial authorities refused to acknowledge.\"",

The group emerged in 1960 from the student-led sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Greensboro, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee and played a key role in helping black people in the South both register and exercise their right to vote.\n\nIn a November 1965 staff meeting, SNCC decided to issue a public statement about the Vietnam War, although some workers voiced concern about the political consequences. One worker wrote \"While we care a great deal about both Vietnam and civil rights, we can\u2019t do anything to help the Vietnam situation, and we can hurt ourselves by trying.\"\n\nOn January 3rd, 1966, twenty-one year old civil rights activist Sammy Younge was murdered by white supremacists in Tuskegee, Alabama. His death pushed SNCC to make a public stance on the war, regardless of the political consequences.\n\nThree days later, on January 6th, SNCC\u2019s Executive Committee released a statement on the Vietnam War, writing \"the murder of Samuel Young in Tuskegee, Alabama, is no different than the murder of peasants in Vietnam, for both Young and the Vietnamese sought, and are seeking, to secure the rights guaranteed them by law.\" Here is an excerpt from their statement:\n\n\"We believe the United States government has been deceptive in its claims of concern for the freedom of the Vietnamese people, just as the government has been deceptive in claiming concern for the freedom of colored people in other countries as the Dominican Republic, the Congo, South Africa, Rhodesia, and in the United States itself.\n\n...We question, then, the ability and even the desire of the United States government to guarantee free elections abroad. We maintain that our country's cry of 'preserve freedom in the world' is a hypocritical mask, behind which it squashes liberation movements which are not bound, and refuse to be bound, by the expediencies of United States cold war policies.\n\n...We recoil with horror at the inconsistency of a supposedly 'free' society where responsibility to freedom is equated with the responsibility to lend oneself to military aggression...We ask, where is the draft for the freedom fight in the United States?\"",

The city was quickly placed under martial law.\n\nThe \"Semana Tr\u00e1gica\" (Tragic Week in English, not to be confused with the Spanish Tragic Week) was the violent supression of a general workers' uprising, beginning with the attack on January 7th. In addition to the actions of the police and military, right-wing vigilantes launched pogroms against the city's Jews, many of whom were not involved, in order to suppress the rebellion.\n\nThe conflict began as a strike at the Vasena metal works, an English Argentine-owned plant in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. On January 7th, workers overturned and set fire to the car of the police chief Elpidio Gonz\u00e1lez. Militant workers also shot and killed the commander of the Army detachment protecting Gonz\u00e1lez. Following this, police attacked, killing five workers and wounding twenty more.\n\nOn the same day, maritime workers of the port of Buenos Aires voted in favor of a general strike for better hours and wages. After the police attack at Vasena, a waterfront strike began: all ship movements, and all loading and unloading, came to a halt.\n\nRioting soon spread throughout Buenos Aires, and workers battled with both state and right-wing paramilitary forces. Police utilized members of the far-right Argentine \"Patriotic League\", who targeted the city's working class Russian Jewish population, which they associated with the rebellion, beating and murdering many uninvolved civilians.\n\nOn the 11th, the city was placed under martial law, and the military restored control over the city over the next several days. Estimates of the death toll range from between 141 to over 700. The United States embassy reported that 1,500 people were killed in total, \"mostly Russians and generally Jews\", and that many women were raped.",

        "description": "On this day in 1972, all the coal miners in Britain went on strike, the first official national miners' strike since 1926. After the Battle of Saltley Gate rendered the last large stockpile of fuel inaccessible in February, workers won their demands.\n\nThe dispute arose from pay negotiations. Miners, led by Joe Gormley, initially asked for pay rises of between 35-47%, while the National Coal Board (NCB) was only prepared to offer 7.4%. After the strike began, all 289 coal mines in the country ceased production.\n\nAt the beginning of the strike, it was estimated that there were sufficient stockpiles of fuel to supply national requirements for about 8 weeks, however the fuel was unevenly distributed throughout the country. The success of the strike depended on ensuring the scarcity of fuel.\n\nAccordingly, the miners enjoyed solidarity from other industries - engineers ceased working at collieries, train drivers refused to drive trains carrying fuel, and dockworkers refused to unload ships carrying coal.\n\nUnder guidelines agreed between the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the NCB, and the government, dispensation was given to allow fuel to be transported to \"priority consumers\", i.e., hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, and, later, schools.\n\nBy February, the last large accessible stockpile of solid fuel in the country was held by a West Midlands Gas Board (WMGB) coke plant in Birmingham, where up to 700 vehicles were collecting fuel each day for in miles-long queues. The WMGB argued that they could stay open because they did not employ miners directly.\n\nThousands of picketing workers descended on the open coke works, attempting to close it, but were initially repelled by a large police force. Arthur Scargill, a left-wing leader of the strike and NUM member, asked for solidarity from local engineering unions.\n\nWith their support, more than 10,000 workers managed to close the depot on February 10th, an event known as \"The Battle of Saltley Gate\". With the country facing massive power outages, the government conceded to worker demands.\n\n\"The victory on the 10 February was a battle between the working class and the government, which the working class won.\"\n\n- Peter Jackson, of the Birmingham Trades Council",

Choe Jeu was executed by the state in 1864.\n\nAmidst a backdrop of growing foreign influence in Korea (which would eventually lead to colonization by Japan), Donghak peasants rebelled against oppression by feudal rulers. The uprising began in the county of Gobu in Jeolla province, where the magistrate had extorted vast amounts of wealth and forced the peasants to build a reservoir.\n\nOn January 10th, 1894, approximately 1,000 peasant rebels gathered at an empty horse ranch, from which they split off into two separate armies where they successfully destroyed three of Gobu's four gates, occupied government offices, and set about destroying prisons and freeing the people held in them.\n\nAs rebels successfully defeated government forces, unrest would spread across the country, and the panicked Joseon dynasty called for Chinese Qing dynasty for support. Doing this, however, aggrieved the Japanese government, which was competing with China for influence over Korea.\n\nJapan invaded Korea, occupying Seoul, triggering the First Sino-Japanese War. Following a temporary truce, the peasant rebellion would resume in October, this time directed towards the Japanese occupation.\n\nThe Japanese proved successful in defeating the uprising, however, continuing to quell rebels through 1895. Korea would become increasingly absorbed into Japan's sphere of influence before official annexation in 1910.",

His school eschewed punishments and rewards, and encouraged practical experience over academic study.\n\nIn mid-1909, Ferrer was arrested and accused of orchestrating a week of insurrection in Barcelona known as the \"Tragic Week\". He was convicted in a show trial and executed by firing squad on October 13th, 1909.\n\nFerrer's death triggered international outcry, and his life was prominently memorialized in writing, monuments, and demonstrations across three continents.

Mella had studied law in the University of Havana, but was expelled in 1925.\n\nAlthough Cuba already had various anti-capitalist parties, Julio Mella helped found the \"international\" Cuban Communist Party, recognized by the Soviet Union in 1925, during the Machado regime.\n\nAt the time of his murder, Mella was working as a Marxist revolutionary in Mexico, collaborating with other exiles and supporters to organize the overthrow of General Gerardo Machado in Cuba.\n\nMella was assassinated on January 10th, 1929, while walking home at night with revolutionary photographer Tina Modotti. It is unknown who killed Mella, as both Machado and the Cuban Communist Party, which was afraid Mella had come under the influence of Trotsky (who lived in Mexico at the time), had cause to assassinate him.\n\nThe Cuban government's official position is that Machado had Mella assassinated, while also acknowledging that Modotti was a Stalin-aligned agent. On September 29th, 1933 the troops of Fulgencio Batista, less than a month in power, broke up a procession to bury his ashes in Havana, shooting as many as six people.",

In 1975, Chamorro wrote to Somoza, stating \"I am waiting, with a clear conscience, and a soul at peace, for the blow you are to deliver.\"\n\nOn January 10th, 1978, at 53 years old, Chamorro was shot 18 times by three men in a car who forced his auto to the curb. In the aftermath of his death, tens of thousands of Nicaraguans took to the streets in anti-government protests. A general strike broke out in the capital Managua, paralyzing the city.\n\nThe following year, the decades long rule of the Somoza regime finally came to an end when Anastasio Somoza was ousted, fleeing to Miami. The anti-capitalist Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) came into power, making significant gains in literacy, health care, education, childcare, unions, and land reform.\n\nIn 1990, Pedro's widow Violeta Charmorro became the first and only female President of Nicaragua, serving until 1997.",

One anarchist, Maria Silva Cruz, survived the fire and emerged with a child, a boy, still alive.\n\nSoldiers and police then arrested anyone in the village who possessed a gun, marched them to the smoking ashes of the cottage and their dead colleagues, and shot them in the back. Between twenty-one and twenty-four people died during the incident.\n\nThe massacre led to widespread outrage among left-wing groups, some of which had previously participated in the Second Spanish Republic, significantly undermining support for and compliance with the government.",

Workers, mostly immigrant women and children, won their demands after months of violence and national press campaigns.\n\nThe strike was led by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and united immigrant workers of over forty nationalities. Prompted by a two-hour pay cut following a new law shortening women's workweeks, the strike spread rapidly through the town, growing to more than twenty thousand workers and involving nearly every mill in Lawrence.\n\nNational attention to the strike greatly increased when two IWW leaders, \"Smiling Joe\" Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, were arrested on fabricated charges related to the murder of a striking worker. Upon their arrest, \"Big Bill\" Haywood and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn took over leadership of the strike. They further sensationalized the condition of the striking workers by ostentatiously sending their hungry children to stay with families and supporters in New York City.\n\nStriking workers and families were brutalized by police. When authorities tried to prevent more children from leaving the city, the police attacked a crowd of parents and their children, causing one pregnant woman to miscarry.\n\nGrowing national sympathy for the strikers finally led the mill owners to agree to worker demands, and the parties agreed on significant pay raises to return to work.\n\nEttor and Giovannitti were in prison for months after the strike ended, but were eventually acquitted of all charges.",

As an adult, Honkala was forced to move out of her apartment with her young son, and they were compelled to live out of their car, a white Camaro.\n\nTheir situation was made more dire after the Camaro was demolished by a drunk driver, and Honkala could not find a shelter that would allow them to remain together that winter.\n\nTo stay together and keep from freezing, Honkala decided to move into an abandoned Housing and Urban Development (HUD) home. At a press conference, she stated \"This is me, this is my nine-year-old son, and we're not leaving until somebody can tell us where we can live and not freeze to death.\"\n\nIn Philadelphia, she co-founded the Kensington Welfare Rights Union (KWRU) and the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign (PPEHRC). She has organized numerous protests, holding marches, demonstrations and setting up tent cities, over the course of which she claims to have been arrested more than 200 times for civil disobedience.\n\nIn 2011, Honkala ran for Sheriff of Philadelphia, promising to refuse to evict families from their homes. She finished in third place with over 10,000 votes.\n\n\"It's easier to do horrible things to people if you don't really see them as people.\"\n\n- Cheri Honkala",

Although the strike was declared illegal, workers persisted and won major concessions 12 days later.\n\nIn 1945, Kenya was a colony of Great Britain. Threats of a worker strike due to low wages led the British to create an investigatory \"Phillips Committee\", but, by the end of 1946, workers in Mombasa were upset with any meaningful change.\n\nIn December 1946, workers held mass meetings, rumors spread about a potential strike, and government officials worked to prevent any labor action. On January 7th, 1947, 3,000 workers met to organize a strike, which began on the 13th with more than 15,000 workers, approximately 75% of the workforce in Mombasa, engaging in a general strike.\n\nThe labor stoppage crossed many industries, including government, railroad, hotel, domestic workers, and dock workers. Taxi drivers went around the city spreading word of the strike and urging others to participate.\n\nThe government immediately declared the strike illegal, citing the \"Defense Regulations\", which mandated the port at Mombasa to stay open, as it was the only major access site to Kenya Colony and Uganda.\n\nDespite this, workers persisted, meeting every day at a soccer field to organize. On the second day of the strike, 10,000 workers showed up to the daily meeting, which was run with no official leader, giving everyone an opportunity to speak.\n\nAfter more than a week of the city being paralyzed, a government official promised to gain improvements in working conditions within three months if the people would end their strike. Workers agreed and, on January 25th, 1947, all workers returned to their jobs.\n\nAt the end of March, workers were given a 20-40% wage increase, housing allowances, paid holidays, paid overtime, and a higher minimum wage.",

Despite being tried in absentia, Ben Ali successfully evaded arrest in Saudi Arabia, dying there in 2019 at the age of 83.\n\nAfter Ben Ali was ousted from power, the police and army defected from the state and sided with protesters. Labor unions, such as the UGTT, also played an integral role in organizing the mass protests.\n\nDespite achieving a more democratic government, Tunisia remains in political crisis. On July 25th, 2021, amid ongoing anti-government protests, President Kais Saied suspended parliament, dismissed the Prime Minister, and withdrew immunity of parliament members.",

In 1965, he helped organize the Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War.\n\nFor his activism, King was the target of multiple assassination attempts, arrested 23 times, and surveilled and harassed by the U.S. government. In particular, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover targeted by Dr. King by making him a target of COINTELPRO, a secret program where FBI agents spied on, infiltrated, and attempted to discredit \"subversive\" political movements.\n\nIn 1968, King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference organized the \"Poor People's Campaign\" to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble \"a multiracial army of the poor\" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an \"economic bill of rights\" for poor Americans.\n\nBefore the plans for the march could come to fruition, however, King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee while supporting striking black sanitation workers.

        "description": "Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, born on this day in 1809, was a French politician, philosopher, and founder of mutualist philosophy.\n\nProudhon was the first person to declare himself an anarchist and is widely regarded as one of the ideology's most influential theorists, sometimes called \"the father of anarchism\". He became a member of the French Parliament after the Revolution of 1848, afterwards referring to himself as a federalist.\n\nProudhon favored workers' associations or co-operatives as well as individual worker and peasant possession over private ownership or the nationalization of land and workplaces. In \"The Confessions of a Revolutionary\", Proudhon asserted that \"Anarchy is Order Without Power\", the phrase which much later inspired in the view of some the anarchist circled-A symbol.\n\nIt is worth noting that, despite his egalitarian beliefs in other respects, Proudhon was an avowed sexist and anti-Semite. One unpublished quote reads \"The Jew is the enemy of the human race. This race must be sent back to Asia, or exterminated.\" Proudhon also maintained that a woman's choice was to be \"courtesan or housekeeper\", stating that man is \"a father, a chief, a master: above all, a master\".\n\nThese views did not go uncontested amongst his colleagues. Joseph D\u00e9jacque, a contemporary libertarian communist, told Proudhon to \"speak out against man's exploitation of woman\" or \"do not describe yourself as an anarchist\".\n\nProudhon unsuccessfully tried to create a national bank, to be funded by what became an abortive attempt at an income tax on capitalists and shareholders. Similar in some respects to a credit union, it would have given interest-free loans.\n\n\"I build no system. I ask an end to privilege, the abolition of slavery, equality of rights, and the reign of law. Justice, nothing else; that is the alpha and omega of my argument: to others I leave the business of governing the world.\"\n\n- Pierre-Joseph Proudhon",

The uprising was forcibly put down by the Freikorps and, for their role in it, both Luxemburg and Liebknecht were tortured and summarily executed by the government forces on this day that year.\n\nKarl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg have since become celebrated martyrs of the German left. Since 1919, an annual Liebknecht-Luxemburg Demonstration has been held in Berlin, the world's largest funerary parade and the biggest meeting of the German left. The annual \"L-L Demo\" is held on the second Sunday in January. In 2016, 14,000 people attended the rally in Liebknecht's and Luxemburg's honor.\n\nEpitaphs composed by German playwright Bertolt Brecht read as follows:\n\nEpitaph for Karl Liebknecht\nHere lies\nKarl Liebknecht\nThe fighter against war\nWhen he was struck down\nOur city still continued to stand.\n\nEpitaph for Rosa Luxemburg\nHere lies buried\nRosa Luxemburg\nA Jewess from Poland\nChampion of the German workers Murdered on the orders of\nThe German oppressors. Oppressed;\nBury your differences!\n\n\"Marxism is a revolutionary worldview that must always struggle for new revelations. Marxism must abhor nothing so much as the possibility that it becomes congealed in its current form. It is at its best when butting heads in self-criticism, and in historical thunder and lightning, it retains its strength.\"\n\n- Rosa Luxemburg",

A small group of Beninese political exiles would make their home in France and conspire with Robert Denard, a notorious French, anti-communist, imperialist mercenary.\n\nDenard and the exiles would form a small army of around 150 hired guns. Led by Denard, this group created a planned to depose K\u00e9r\u00e9kou and received funds, arms, and training from several pro-French African governments, including Morocco, Togo, and the Ivory Coast.\n\nThe mercenaries departed from a Gabonese airstrip in the early hours of January 16th, 1977, disguised as a civilian aircraft and destined for Cotonou, the executive seat of the government of Benin.\n\nUpon landing at the Cotonou airport around 7 am, the mercenaries quickly took control of both air traffic control and the airport's main terminal, then advanced towards the Presidential Palace.\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9kou, informed of the ongoing assault, would call on civilians over the radio to take up arms in defense against the coup. The Army, Presidential Guard, which President K\u00e9r\u00e9kou had expanded North Korean soldiers, and armed civilians defend the Presidential Palace until the mercenaries retreated back to the airport and returned to Gabon.\n\nSeven Beninese were killed during the attack: 6 soldiers and 1 civilian. A large monument in central Cotonou was erected in their memory in 1979.\n\nToday, January 16th is celebrated as Martyr's Day in Benin to commemorate those who lost their lives fighting against neo-colonialism.",

He addressed the court on this day in 1933, stating \"You cannot kill the working class\".\n\nAfter nearly 1,000 unemployed workers, both black and white, demonstrated at the Atlanta federal courthouse on June 30th, 1932, local officials began to monitor known and suspected radicals. On July 11th, Herndon, an active labor organizer in the area, was arrested while checking on his mail. A few days later his hotel room was searched, and Communist Party publications were found.\n\nHerndon was charged with insurrection under a Georgia Reconstruction era law. His case went to the Supreme Court twice, and Herndon was freed when the insurrection charge was finally ruled unconstitutional in 1937.\n\nHere is an excerpt of what Herndon said to the court on January 16th, 1933, at 19 years of age:\n\n\"You may do what you will with Angelo Herndon. You may indict him. You may put him in jail. But there will come thousands of Angelo Herndons. If you really want to do anything about the case, you must go out and indict the social system. But this you will not do, for your role is to defend the system under which the toiling masses are robbed and oppressed...\n\nYou may succeed in killing one, two, even a score of working-class organizers.

        "description": "Patrice Lumumba was a Congolese anti-colonial revolutionary assassinated by U.S. and Belgian assisted forces on this day in 1961, after serving as Prime Minister. Lumumba had served as the first Prime Minister of the independent Democratic Republic of the Congo from June until September 1960, and played a significant role in the transformation of the Congo from a colony of Belgium into an independent republic.\n\nIdeologically an African nationalist and pan-Africanist, Lumumba led the Congolese National Movement (MNC) party from 1958 until his assassination, in a coup by Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu, assisted by U.S. and Belgian forces. The coup occurred when Lumumba, facing armed rebellion and an occupation by Belgian forces, asked for support from the Soviet Union. This led to a government split between himself, President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, and military commander Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu.\n\nOn December 1st, 1960, Lumumba was captured by Mobutu's forces and imprisoned. On January 17th, 1961, he and his associates were brutally beaten and tortured by Katangan and Belgian officers, and Lumumba was executed later that night. The execution was carried out with Belgian and U.S. assistance. Belgium formally apologized for its role in the assassination in 2002.\n\nOn Lumumba's legacy, his friend and colleague Thomas Kanza wrote the following:\n\n\"He lived as a free man, and an independent thinker. Everything he wrote, said and did was the product of someone who knew his vocation to be that of a liberator, and he represents for the Congo what Castro does for Cuba, Nasser for Egypt, Nkrumah for Ghana, Mao Tse-tung for China, and Lenin for Russia.\"\n\n\"No Congolese worthy of the name will ever to be able to forget that this independence has been won through a struggle in which we did not spare our energy and our blood...We have known ironies, insults, and blows which we had to undergo morning, noon and night because we were Negroes. We have seen our lands spoiled in the name of laws which only recognized the right of the strongest. We have known laws which differed according to whether it dealt with a black man or a white. We have known the atrocious sufferings of those who were imprisoned for their political opinions or religious beliefs, and of those exiled in their own country. Their fate was worse than death itself. Who will forget the rifle-fire from which so many of our brothers perished, or the jails in to which were brutally thrown those who did not want to submit to a regime of justice, oppression and exploitation which were the means the colonialists employed to dominate us?\"\n\n- Patrice Lumumba",

The CPC went on to achieve a new base of operations in Shaanxi Province and continued its revolutionary activity from there.\n\nThe Conference was completely unacknowledged until the 1950s and still no detailed descriptions were available until the fiftieth anniversary in 1985.

Badger addressed the wearers at the depot and gave them the choice of removing the badges or not working; most chose the right to wear the badges, and later 10,000 workers marched to modern day King George Square to listen to labor organizers speak.\n\nForty-three Brisbane based Trade Unions subsequently formed the Combined Unions Committee and appointed a General Strike Committee. The General Strike Committee planned for a general strike on January 30th and began functioning as an alternative government in the area, whose approval became needed for work to be done.\n\nAs planned, trade unionists of Brisbane went out on a general strike January 30th, 1912, not just for the right to wear a badge but also for the basic right to join a union. Brisbane was brought to a standstill by the next day - trains didn't run, hotels were closed, most transport shut down, and most food shops were closed. Only shops with special permits issued by the Committee were opened in order to keep the Australian government running at the minimal margin.\n\nWorkers celebrated with parades, speeches, and sporting contests. The government began prohibiting these demonstrations, and, when 15,000 workers defied this ban on February 2nd, 1912, they were attacked by police. Strikers and their family members were beaten and arrested en masse.\n\nEmma Miller, a 70-year old trade unionist and suffragist, stood her ground and stabbed the rump of the Police Commissioner's horse. The horse threw the Commissioner to the ground, giving him life-long limp.\n\nThe strike failed due to a lack of money and particularly food. It officially ended when the Employers Federation, supporting the strike, agreed on the March 6th, 1912 that there would be no victimization of strikers from Badger and the company.\n\nDespite this, many workers who had participated were blacklisted by Badger until 1922, when the Queensland Government acquired the tram system and reinstated them. Wearing of union badges on uniforms remained forbidden until 1980.",

Markelov was a lawyer who defended left-wing political activists, anti-fascists, journalists, and victims of police violence.\n\nOn January 19th, 2009, Markelov gave a press conference where he fiercely denounced the early prison release of a Russian army officer, convicted for the abduction and murder of a Chechen girl. After finishing, a masked assailant shot him in the back of the head, killing him instantly. Baburova, who was covering the press conference, was shot and killed after trying to stop the shooter.\n\nIn May 2011, the shooter Nikita Tikhonov was sentenced to life imprisonment, and his partner Eugenia Khasis was sentenced to 18 years in prison.\n\nRussian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer has speculated that the Russian government was involved, noting that Tikhonov's use of a pistol fitted with a silencer was atypical for the neo-Nazi movement, which usually used knives and homemade explosives to commit violence.",

Agee ultimately defected to Cuba, dying there in 2008.\n\nPhilip Agee (1935 - 2008) served as a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer for eight years, joining the organization in 1960. He was assigned posts in Montevideo, Mexico City, and Quito, Ecuador.\n\nAgee resigned from the CIA in 1968 following the Tlatelolco massacre in Mexico City, in which the U.S.-supported government engaged in mass shootings and arrests of a crowd of more than ten thousand protesters. The same massacre also played a role in the political radicalization of Subcomandante Marcos of the Zapatistas.\n\nAgee moved to London and published \"Inside the Company\", a tell-all text that, among other things, detailed his work in spying on diplomats, engaging in illegal activity to force a diplomatic break between Ecuador and Cuba, naming President Jos\u00e9 Figueres Ferrer of Costa Rica, President Luis Echeverr\u00eda \u00c1lvarez of Mexico, and President Alfonso L\u00f3pez Michelsen of Colombia as CIA collaborators, and exposing the identities of dozens of CIA agents.\n\nFor the exposure of agents, Agee was expelled from the United Kingdom. Agee was also eventually expelled from the Netherlands, France, West Germany and Italy, and was compelled to live under a series of socialist governments - Grenada under Maurice Bishop, then Nicaragua under the Sandinistas, and finally Cuba under Castro. Agee died in Cuba in January 2008.\n\n\"I don't think we have ever had real democracy in this country.

And those men who wrote the constitution were representatives of the elites. They were the lawyers, bankers, merchants, the land owners, slave owners and so forth. And they write the constitution for their own private interest$. That is how government has served ever since. And that is why we have so little democracy in United States.\"\n\n- Philip Agee",

Cabral was one of Africa's foremost anti-colonial leaders, leading the nationalist movement of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde Islands and the ensuing war of independence in Guinea-Bissau.\n\nFrom 1963 until his death, he led the Partido Africano da Independ\u00eancia da Guin\u00e9 e Cabo Verde (PAIGC) guerrilla movement against the Portuguese government, beginning a decade-long, but ultimately successful war of liberation. The goal of the conflict was to achieve independence from both Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde.\n\nCabral was assassinated on January 20th, 1973 by at PAIGC headquarters in Conakry by PAIGC veteran Inoc\u00eancio Kani and Portuguese agents, according to historian Lucy Burnett. Eight months later, Guinea-Bissau issued a unilateral declaration of independence. Cabral's pan-Africanism and revolutionary socialism continues to be an inspiration for socialists and national independence movements worldwide.\n\n\"In combating racism we do not make progress if we combat the people themselves.

Here, the policy of Jewish genocide was explicitly architected, although the \"Final Solution\" had been approved one year earlier.\n\nThe conference was attended by 15 high-ranking party and state officials, headed by Reinhard Heydrich, SS Lieutenant-General and head of the Reich Security Main Office. Other important attendees included Heinrich M\u00fcller, chief of the Gestapo, and Adolf Eichmann, who was executed in 1962 for war crimes in Jerusalem.\n\nBecause a policy of mass extermination had already been approved by Hitler in 1941 (especially as mass killings of Jews had already begun in occupied Europe), the historical importance of the meeting was not recognized by those present.\n\nThe purpose of formalizing the logistics behind the \"Final Solution's\" implementation was simply to emphasize that, once the deportations had been completed, the fate of the deportees became an internal matter of the SS, totally outside the purview of any other agency. Heydrich estimated that there were around 11 million Jews in Europe who would be targeted for extermination. Within a few months of the Wannsee Conference, the Nazis would begin installing the first poison-gas chambers in Polish extermination camps.\n\nOn January 20th, 1992, on the fiftieth anniversary of the meeting, the site was finally opened as a Holocaust memorial and museum known as the Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz (House of the Wannsee Conference).\n\n\"Those who suffer from conspiracy phobia are fond of saying: 'Do you actually think there's a group of people sitting around in a room plotting things?'

After two years of guerilla warfare against British occupation and ~2,300 deaths, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed, creating the Irish Free State.\n\nIn April 1916, Irish republicans had launched the Easter Rising against British rule, proclaiming an Irish Republic. Although the rebellion was suppressed, the incident led to greater popular support for Irish independence. In December 1918 elections, just a month prior to their independence declaration, republican party Sinn F\u00e9in won a landslide victory.\n\nOn January 21st, 1919 Sinn F\u00e9in formed a breakaway government (D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann). The same day, two Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) officers were killed in the Soloheadbeg ambush by Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteers.\n\nThroughout 1919, the IRA went about capturing weapons and freeing republican prisoners while the D\u00e1il began building up a state. In September, the British government outlawed the D\u00e1il and Sinn F\u00e9in, and the conflict intensified.\n\nOver the following two years, the IRA waged a campaign of guerilla warfare against British occupiers. In total, approximately 2,300 people were killed - 936 of the British-aligned forces, 491 of the Irish-aligned forces, and 900 civilians.\n\nThe British government bolstered the RIC with recruits from Britain, the \"Black and Tans and Auxiliaries\", who became notorious for ill-discipline and reprisal attacks on civilians.\n\nOn December 6th, 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed, bringing an end to the 1919 Irish War of Independence. The treaty formally recognized the Irish Free State and led to the creation of Northern Ireland, partitioning the island.\n\n\"If you remove the English Army tomorrow and hoist the green flag over Dublin Castle, unless you set about the organization of the Socialist Republic your efforts will be in vain.

She was highly critical of the existing political system in Japan, which led her to call for an anarchism to exist in \"everyday practice\", namely that people should in various small ways seek routinely to undermine the kokutai (a sense of national body politic). It\u014d also translated anarchist writings into Japanese, including works of Emma Goldman.\n\nOn September 16th, 1923, It\u014d, \u014csugi, and his 6-year-old nephew Munekazu were arrested, strangled to death, and thrown into an abandoned well by a squad of military police known as the \"Kenpeitai\".

Following his death, his wife Krupskaya circulated \"Lenin's Testament\", a letter in which he criticized Party leadership and made suggestions for the future.\n\nThe majority of the Testament had been dictated by Lenin to his secretary, Lidya Fotieva, on December 25th, 1922, with a postscript added on January 4th, 1923, approximately a year before his death.\n\nIn the letter, Lenin expressed concerns over the stability of the Central Committee, and by extension the Communist Party, writing \"Our party rests upon two classes, and for that reason its instability is possible, and if there cannot exist an agreement between such classes its fall is inevitable...I have in mind stability as a guarantee against a split n the near future, and I intend to examine here a series of considerations of a purely personal character.\"\n\nLenin goes on to state that the personal relationship between Stalin and Trotsky could cause such a split: \"I think that the fundamental factor in the matter of stability \u2013 from this point of view \u2013 as such members of the Central Committee as Stalin and Trotsky. The relation between them constitutes, in my opinion, a big half of the danger of that split...\"\n\nIn the letter's postscript, dated January 4th, Lenin calls Stalin \"rude\" and recommends Party members to find another General Secretary, \"another man who in all respects differs from Stalin only in superiority \u2013 namely, more patient, more loyal, more polite and more attentive to comrades, less capricious, etc.\"\n\nAfter, Lenin's death, his surviving widow, Nadezhda, began circulating the document and attempted to present it at the 13th Congress. By a vote of 30 to 10, party leadership refused to have the document read to the congress. The Testament was, however, published by anti-communists; the full English text of Lenin's testament was published as part of a 1926 New York Times article.\n\nBill Bland, a Marxist-Leninist historian, notes that the contents of the letter mark a striking reversal to Lenin's previous assessment of both Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin had been elected General Secretary of the Central Committee in April 1922 on Lenin's proposal. While Lenin praises Trotsky as the \"the most able man in the present Central Committee\" in the letter, Lenin had previously referred to Trotsky as \"Judas Trotsky\" and \"swine\".\n\nHistorian Stephen Kotkin argued that the evidence for Lenin's authorship of the Testament is weak and suggested that the document could have been created by Krupskaya, although other historians, such as Isaac Deutscher and Dmitri Volkogonov, accepted its legitimacy. Trotskyist journal The New International noted in 1935 that Stalin himself acknowledged Lenin as the author in a 1927 speech.",

        "description": "Antonio Gramsci, born on this day in 1891, was an Italian Marxist philosopher and communist politician. His works touch on a variety of topics, including political theory, sociology, history, and linguistics.\n\nGramsci was a founding member and leader of the Communist Party of Italy and was imprisoned by Benito Mussolini's fascist regime. Gramsci wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. His \"Prison Notebooks\" are considered a highly original contribution to 20th-century political theory.\n\nToday, Gramsci is perhaps best known for his concept of cultural hegemony, which describes how the state and ruling capitalist class use cultural institutions to maintain power in capitalist societies without resorting to force. Hegemonic culture promotes capitalist values and norms such that they become the \"common sense\" values of all and reinforce the status quo.\n\n\"The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born.\"\n\n- Antonio Gramsci",

        "description": "On this day in 1905, troops at the Russian Winter Palace fired upon a huge procession of working class demonstrators, killing hundreds. The massacre, known as \"Bloody Sunday\", led to widespread uprisings and sweeping reforms in what is known as the Russian Revolution of 1905.\n\nThe revolt took place amidst widespread discontent with conditions under the Tsarist absolute monarchy, and a growing proliferation of political radicalism. Although mass strikes broke out weeks earlier in St. Petersburg, the beginning of the revolution is typically marked by the \"Bloody Sunday\" massacre on January 22nd, when unarmed protesters marching towards the Winter Palace to present a petition to Tsar Nicholas were fired upon by soldiers, killing hundreds.\n\nIn response to the massacre, mass worker resistance exploded across the Russian empire. Half of European Russia's industrial workers went on strike in 1905, 93.2% in Poland. The Tsar's uncle was assassinated on February 17th.\n\nOn March 2nd, the Tsar agreed to the establishment of a legislature, the State Duma. However, with the body's powers remaining limited (initially only given consultative powers), the rebels were emboldened to push harder.\n\nSummer saw peasant rebellion and mutinies (Russia being at war with Japan at the time), most famously the mutiny on the battleship Potemkin, triggered when sailors refused to eat borscht made from maggot-infested meat.\n\nAs strikes continued, the government announced a Manifesto on October 17th, enacting emergency civil reform to placate the masses, and successfully crushed remaining resistance in the following months, such as the Moscow Uprising in December.\n\nThe uprising is considered the predecessor to the Russian Revolution of 1917 which led to the establishment of the Soviet Union; Vladimir Lenin called it \"The Great Dress Rehearsal\", without which the \"victory of the October Revolution in 1917 would have been impossible\".",

The war is also known as \"Portugal's Vietnam\".\n\nFought between Portugal and the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), the war is referred to as \"Portugal's Vietnam\" due to the large numbers of men and amounts of material expended in a long, mostly guerrilla war and the internal political turmoil it created in Portugal. Until his assassination in 1973, Pan-African socialist Am\u00edlcar Cabral played a key role in the revolutionary activity of PAIGC.\n\nThe first act of the revolution took place on January 23rd, when PAIGC guerrillas attacked a Portuguese garrison in Tite, near the Corubal River, south of Bissau. Similar guerrilla actions quickly spread across the colony. PAIGC had few weapons - perhaps only one submachine gun and two pistols per group - and so they attacked Portuguese convoys to gain more weapons.\n\nThe war ended when Portugal, after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, granted independence to Guinea-Bissau, with Cape Verde's independence following a year later.",

Among those executed were Uchiyama Gud\u014d, a Buddhist priest and socialist who spoke out against the Meiji government for its imperialism and advocated for conscripted soldiers to desert en masse.\n\nThe pretext for this crackdown was the \"High Treason Incident\", a plot to assassinate the Emperor of Japan. The incident began when police searched the room of Miyashita Takichi, a young lumbermill employee, and found materials which could be used to construct bombs, concluding that there was a broader conspiracy to harm the imperial family.\n\nOn the basis of this plot, the Japanese government rounded up leftist activists from all over the country. 24 of the 26 defendants actually brought to trial were sentenced to death, despite the evidence against nearly all of them being circumstantial.\n\nAmong those executed anarcha-feminist journalist Kanno Sugako (some sources say she was executed on January 25th). At the age of 29, Kanno became the first woman with the status of political prisoner to be executed in the history of modern Japan.\n\nPrior to his execution, K\u014dtoku Sh\u016bsui etched this message on the wall of his cell: \"How has it come about that I have committed this grave crime? Today my trial is hidden from outside observers and I have even less liberty than previously to speak about these events. Perhaps in 100 years someone will speak out about them on my behalf.\"",

        "description": "On this day in 1979, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, a labor union representing migrant farm workers, initiated a boycott against Campbell's and Nestle products to achieve union recognition and higher wages. The Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) was founded in 1967 in Toledo, Ohio by Baldemar Velasquez.\n\nIn 1978, Velasquez planned an ambitious labor action, noting that Ohio tomato growers would be unable to recruit enough workers to see them through a long strike. That year, 2,000 FLOC members walked off their jobs in Ohio, demanding a guaranteed minimum wage, better housing, and medical care.\n\nWhile some growers were willing to negotiate, big canners such as Campbell's and Nestle were unwilling to pay the higher prices which would accompany a unionized workforce. FLOC reacted by boycotting their products and marching 560 miles from Toledo, Ohio to Campbell's headquarters in Camden, New Jersey in a well-publicized protest.\n\nA resolution finally came in 1986 when FLOC, growers, and Campbell's announced a collective bargaining agreement which achieved union recognition and provided for wage increases, grievance resolution, health insurance, and committees to study pesticide safety, housing, health care, and day care issues.\n\nShortly thereafter, FLOC reached deals with Vlasic, Heinz, Dean Foods, and 23 of the largest cucumber growers in Ohio and Michigan.",

        "description": "Fumiko Kaneko, born on this day in 1903, was a Japanese anarchist, nihilist, and opponent to Japanese imperialism in Korea. Fumiko is perhaps best remembered for her \"The Prison Memoirs Of A Japanese Woman\", written while imprisoned after being convicted of high treason against the Japanese government.\n\nTogether, Fumiko and her Korean partner Pak Yol published two magazines which highlighted the problems Koreans faced under Japanese imperialism and showed influences of their radical politics. Sometime between 1922 and 1923, they also established a group called \"F\"utei-sha (Society of Malcontents)\", which Fumiko identified as a group for direct action against the government.\n\nThese activities soon brought Pak and Fumiko under government scrutiny. In September 1923, the Japanese government therefore made a number of arrests, mostly Koreans, on limited evidence, and among those arrested were Pak and Fumiko.\n\nAfter lengthy judicial proceedings, Fumiko and Pak were convicted of high treason for attempting to obtain bombs with the intention of killing the emperor or his son. They were both sentenced to life in prison, however Fumiko allegedly committed suicide in her cell in 1926.\n\nHere is a short excerpt from one of Fumiko's interrogations while imprisoned (text by Max Res from theanarchistlibrary.org):\n\nQ: Your class?\n\nA: A divine commoner.\n\nQ: How are you employed?\n\nA: My job is tearing down everything that currently exists.",

Dunn helped organize it. Although political radicals led the strike for the first several months, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) took over negotiations in the fall of 1926 on condition of communist activists stepping aside.\n\nThe strike was memorialized by a seven reel silent movie titled \"The Passaic Textile Strike\", intended to generate sympathy and funds for the striking workers. Six of the seven reels survive today.",

She is the author of over ten books, covering topics such as class, feminism, and the U.S. prison system.\n\nBorn to an African-American family in Birmingham, Alabama, Davis studied French at Brandeis University and philosophy at the University of Frankfurt in West Germany. Back in the U.S., she joined the Communist Party and, as a Marxist feminist, involved herself in a range of radical movements, including second-wave feminism, the Black Panther Party, and the campaign against the Vietnam War.\n\nIn 1969, Davis was hired as an acting assistant professor of philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In 1970 UCLA's governing Board of Regents fired her due to her Communist Party membership; after a court ruled this illegal, the university fired her again, this time for her alleged use of \"inflammatory language\".\n\nPraised by Marxists and others on the left, Davis has received numerous awards, including the Lenin Peace Prize in 1980. Davis has also been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame, and was Time magazine's \"Woman of the Year\" for 1971 in its 2020 \"100 Women of the Year\" edition.\n\n\"I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change.

In 2005, the United Nations named today as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nAs Soviet forces approached the camp, Nazis attempted to evacuate prisoners from the camp and to destroy evidence of their atrocities. Approximately 56,000 inmates were forced on a \"death march\" west away from the camp through the Polish winter.\n\nAround 15,000 prisoners (about 1 in 4) perished during their forced march, and, by the time the Soviets had arrived, only 9,000 remained on-site, monitored by a handful of remaining SS guards and staff.\n\nThe buildings themselves were left largely intact, along with large amounts of clothing, seized items, and human hair, alongside the dying prisoners left behind.\n\nOne Red Army general, Vasily Petrenko, is quoted as saying, \"I who saw people dying every day was shocked by the Nazis' indescribable hatred toward the inmates who had turned into living skeletons. I read about the Nazis' treatment of Jews in various leaflets, but there was nothing about the Nazis' treatment of women, children, and old men\".\n\nEfforts were made to document the atrocities, and to hospitalize the remaining inmates. Auschwitz remained in use as an ad hoc facility for German POWs until the end of the war in Europe later that year.\n\nSince 2005, the day has been marked annually by the United Nations as International Holocaust Remembrance Day, commemorating all those targeted and killed by the Third Reich, including around six million Jews and five million others.",

This led to a split in the labor movement, with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) representing the more radical advocacy of labor interests via industrial unionism.\n\nAs AFL President, Gompers promoted collaboration among the different craft unions that comprised the AFL and supported collective bargaining to secure shorter hours and higher wages for laborers.\n\nGompers also successfully promoted anti-immigrant and anti-socialist politics using the influence of the AFL, endorsing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and supporting the U.S. government and its entry into World War I as the state arrested anti-war union leaders.\n\nGompers was particularly critical of the IWW, stating \"the IWWs...are exactly what the Bolsheviki are in Russia, and we have seen what the IWW Bolsheviki in Russia have done for the working people.\"",

Due to his wounds, he could not leave the scene and was arrested there. On June 15th, Wilckens was murdered in prison by a member of the fascist paramilitary \"Liga Patri\u00f3tica Argentina\".\n\nOn the assassination, Wilckens said \"It was not vengeance; I did not see in Varela a minor official. No, he was everything in Patagonia: governor, judge, executioner, and undertaker. I tried to hurt him as the naked symbol of a criminal system. But revenge is unworthy of an Anarchist!

        "description": "On this day in 1573, the Croatian-Slovene Peasant Revolt began with an attack on the fortress of Cesargrad, near the town of Klanjec. Peasants formed their own government, planning to abolish feudalism and establish self-rule.\n\nAmidst growing incursions by Ottoman forces into the region, local feudal lords ramped up economic demands on the local peasantry. One powerful noble, Franjo (or Ferenc) Tahy was particularly notorious for his cruel and violent treatment of the local populace.\n\nComplaints made by peasants to the central government were ignored, so popular resistance efforts began to develop. The local peasantry refused to pay taxes to Tahy, who responded by sending armed mercenaries to attack them, however they were defeated by armed peasants.\n\nOn the night of January 27-28, rebels seized the fortress of Cesargrad, marking the start of the revolt. The peasants formed an alternative government, with serf Matija Gubec elected as leader.\n\nThe rebels made long term plans of systemic reform, including replacing feudal lords with peasant officials, abolishing feudal land holdings and provincial borders, canceling obligations to the Roman Catholic Church, opening of highways for trade, and establishing self-rule by the peasants.\n\nNews of the uprising quickly spread through the discontented lower classes of the region, who followed suit by fighting back against their oppressors, taking further territory throughout Carniola, Croatia and Styria.\n\nThe Croatian Parliament declared the revolutionary peasants traitors. After their initial wave of success, peasant forces suffered a major defeat at Kr\u0161ko on February 5th, which precipitated a further wave of defeats over the coming days.\n\nThe rebels made their final stand at Stubi\u010dke Toplice on the 9th, where the uprising was crushed for good. Matija Gubec was captured, and Ivan Mogai\u0107, another important revolutionary leader, was killed on the battlefield.\n\nCaptives were maimed and tortured by authorities, and Gubec was publicly tortured and executed on the 15th. Although the revolt was unsuccessful, its memory has persisted in the region in the centuries since, with Gubec attaining legendary status in local folklore.\n\nA detachment of Yugoslav volunteers for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War named themselves the \"Grupo Matija Gubec\". In 1975, a film based on the events entitled \"Anno Domini 1573\" was released, and historical re-enactments of the Revolt are held in Croatia every year.",

        "description": "On this day in 1918, the Finnish People's Delegation declared a socialist workers' republic (known \"Red Finland\"), at the start of the Finnish Civil War. The burgeoning working class movement was crushed by imperialist German forces.\n\nPrior to 1917, Finland had been ruled as a Grand Duchy, an autonomous part of the Russian Empire. With the collapse of the Tsarist state in the wake of February Revolution and a long-term increase in nationalist sentiment, Finland declared independence on December 4th, 1917, formally recognized by the Russian Bolsheviks on December 31st.\n\nDue to industrialized Finland having a strong revolutionary labor movement, conservative and proletarian forces were immediately thrown into conflict.\n\nRed Guard paramilitary units representing the labor movement found themselves in a cycle of escalation with loyalist \"White\" Guards, culminating in a mass uprising of Reds in Helsinki on January 27th, 1918, marking the start of revolution. The following day, the Finnish People's Delegation was formed by members of the Social Democratic Party. Bourgeois forces fled to Vaasa, where they set up their own \"White Senate\".\n\nThe war saw the Whites, under the leadership of General Mannerheim, receive support from the German Empire, which was more well-established than the Reds' primary ally, the newly-created Russian Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nFollowing an imperialist intervention by Germany on the side of the Whites in March 1918, the war ended in defeat for the Reds in May. Over 12,000 people perished from starvation and hunger while imprisoned in White-operated POW camps, and reparations were not paid to former victims of the White Terror until 1973.",

        "description": "James Larkin, born on this day in 1874, was an Irish republican, revolutionary socialist, and trade unionist who co-founded the industrial Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU), the Irish Labour Party, and the Irish Citizen's Army (ICA).\n\nLarkin, also known as \"Big Jim\", was born to Irish emigrants and began working from the age of seven years old. He took an interest in socialism at a young age, joining the Independent Labour Party as a teenager.\n\nIn 1905, while working on the docks, Larkin participated in a strike and was elected to the strike committee, losing his foreman's job as a result. The union was impressed with his organizing ability, and he later gained a permanent position with them, beginning his career as a labor organizer.\n\nIn 1908, Larkin began organizing in Dublin, working with other Irish socialists such as James Connolly and William O'Brien. He also initiated a worker's newspaper, The Irish Worker and People's Advocate, however it was subject to censorship and shut down in 1915.\n\nIn 1908, Larkin founded the industrial Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU). Under Larkin's leadership the union continued to grow, reaching approximately 20,000 members in the time leading up to the Dublin lock-out.\n\nIn 1913, led by union busting capitalist William Martin Murphy, over 400 of Dublin's employers began requiring their workers to sign a pledge not to be a member of the ITGWU and not to engage in sympathetic strikes, causing the Dublin lock-out, one of the most severe labor conflicts in Irish history.\n\nLarkin and other labor leaders were arrested for sedition on August 28th while the lock-out continued. Striking workers were subject to police violence, leading Larkin to call for the formation of a workers' militia, the Irish Citizen's Army. During this period, Vladimir Lenin referred to Larkin as 'a remarkable speaker and a man of seething energy [who] has performed miracles amongst the unskilled workers'.\n\nFollowing the lock-out's defeat, Larkin came to the United States to do a speaking tour on invitation of \"Big Bill\" Haywood of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). On November 7th, 1919, during a series of anti-Bolshevik raids, Larkin was arrested and charged with 'criminal anarchy' for helping publish socialist literature.\n\nLarkin eventually returned to Ireland, allying with the newly formed Soviet Union, attending at the 1924 Comintern Congress in Moscow. His relationship with the Soviet Union became strained in the 1930s, as Larkin's syndicalist politics clashed with the Marxism-Leninism of the Comintern.\n\nLarkin spent the rest of his life as a organizer, receiving fatal injuries from a fall while supervising repairs to the Worker's Union of Ireland's Thomas Ashe Hall in Dublin in 1946.\n\n\"No, men and women of the Irish race, we shall not fight for England. We shall fight for the destruction of the British Empire and the construction of an Irish republic.\"\n\n- James Larkin",

As part of this process, in order to fight a typhus outbreak, the workers were forced to strip and bathe in gasoline, which killed any lice on their bodies.\n\nOn the morning of January 28th, Torres refused to be bathed, instead, convincing thirty other Mexican women to get out and protest with her. Within an hour, there were more than 200 women blocking the entrance to El Paso.\n\nBy the end of the protest, the crowd was several thousand strong. They laid in front of trains and vehicles and refused to leave when threatened with guns by the police. Eventually, the riot was subdued and Torres was arrested for her role in starting it.\n\nDespite the energized protest, the noxious delousing continued, later with insecticides like DDT, for decades afterward.",

Two IWW leaders were arrested for her death.\n\nThe Lawrence Textile Strike was a strike of immigrant workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts that began on January 11th, 1912. It was led by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and united immigrant workers of over forty nationalities. Prompted by a two-hour pay cut corresponding to a new law shortening the workweek for women, the strike spread rapidly through the town, growing to more than twenty thousand workers and involving nearly every mill in Lawrence.\n\nLoPizzo was a striking immigrant worker who was killed when, according to IWW literature, officer Oscar Benoit fired into a crowd of protesters who had been cornered and were being attacked by police. Anna LoPizzo was likely an assumed name; historian Ardis Cameron wrote \"relying on old-world practices and principles of collectivity, the immigrant community routinely 'swapped' names and falsified documents to evade 'impossible' laws and ensure mutual survival.\"\n\nAfter her death, two IWW leaders, \"Smiling Joe\" Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, were arrested on fabricated charges related to the murder of a striking worker. Upon their arrest, \"Big Bill\" Haywood and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn took over leadership of the strike. They further sensationalized the condition of the striking workers by conspicuously sending their hungry children to stay with families and supporters in New York City.\n\nThe Lawrence Strike was ultimately won by the IWW and strikers. Eugene V. Debs said this of the ordeal: \"The Victory at Lawrence was the most decisive and far-reaching ever won by organized labor.\"",

They opened the jail, killed the jailor, occupied the barracks, and confiscated government office funds.\n\nOther settlers joined the rebels as well as many foreign socialists and anarchists, mainly militant members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), including Frank Little and Joe Hill. The U.S. government in Calexico and Yuma offered military support to aid the Mexican government's efforts to suppress the rebellion in order to protect hydraulic works of American engineers.\n\nAlthough the rebellion was launched against the rule of Porfirio D\u00edaz, it was was put down by forces loyal to Francisco Madero, a wealthy landowner who supported reforms and became the Mexican President in 1911. The PLM split into factions, with one faction still supporting the incarcerated Mag\u00f3n brothers while the other faction supported Madero, the new president of Mexico.",

        "description": "Marina Ginest\u00e0, born on this day in 1919, was a French-born Spanish communist who served in the Spanish Civil War. She became famous due to the photo taken by Juan Guzm\u00e1n on a Barcelona roof in 1936, when she was just 17 years old (shown).\n\nGinest\u00e0 was born in Toulouse, France to a working-class leftist Jewish family that had emigrated to France from Spain. She moved to Barcelona with her parents at the age of 11. Ginest\u00e0 later joined the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia.\n\nAs the war broke out, she served as a reporter and a translator assisting Mikhail Koltsov, a correspondent of the Soviet newspaper Pravda.\n\nThe famous photograph by Juan Guzm\u00e1n was taken on July 21st, 1936. It shows the 17 year old Ginest\u00e0 wearing an army uniform and posing with a M1916 Spanish Mauser rifle on the top of the original Hotel Col\u00f3n in Barcelona. Because she was a reporter, it was the only time Ginest\u00e0 had carried a gun.\n\nBefore the end of the war, Ginest\u00e0 was wounded and evacuated to Montpellier. As France was occupied by the Nazis, she fled to the Dominican Republic and married a former Republican officer. Marina Ginest\u00e0 died in Paris at the age of 94 in January 2014.\n\nOn the iconic photograph, Ginest\u00e0 stated \"It's a good photo. It reflects the feeling we had at that moment. Socialism had arrived, the hotel guests had left. There was euphoria. We retired in Columbus, we ate well, as if bourgeois life belonged to us and we would have changed category quickly.\"",

        "description": "Bloody Sunday, also known as the Bogside Massacre, was a massacre of Irish anti-internment protesters by the British government that took place on this day in 1972 in the Bogside area of Derry, Northern Ireland.\n\nBloody Sunday resulted in the highest number of people killed in a shooting incident during the Troubles and remains the worst mass shooting in Northern Irish history. This violence was in response to a protest organized by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in opposition to a state policy of internment without trial, introduced in August of 1971.\n\nOn January 18th, 1972, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Brian Faulkner banned all parades and marches in response to widespread civil unrest. The protest march was organized despite this order.\n\nOn the day of the protest, approximately 10,000-15,000 joined the march, however their path was blocked by British Army barriers. The protest descended into chaos, with British soldiers chasing down protesters and attacking them indiscriminately. 26 people were shot, 14 were killed. Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers or attending to the wounded, while others were injured by shrapnel, rubber bullets, batons, or being ran down by army vehicles.\n\nThe soldiers were from the 1st Battalion Parachute Army, which had perpetrated the Ballymurphy Massacre just months prior. The events of Bloody Sunday greatly increased hostilities between Northern Ireland and the British government. Support for and recruitment by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) rose following the massacre.",

Fighting broke out between city police and workers, and labor leaders David Kirkwood and William Gallacher were beaten and taken into custody. During the riot, the sheriff of Lanarkshire called for military aid, and British troops, supported by six tanks, were moved to key points in Glasgow.\n\nKirkwood was found innocent after a photo surfaced of him being struck with a baton from behind by a policeman, however Gallacher served five months in prison. The strike ended on February 12th in defeat for the workers, who did not win a 40-hour work week.",

At the time of the Project's founding, many middle schools, especially those serving non-white communities, did not teach algebra at all. Moses stated - \"We are growing the equivalent of sharecroppers in our inner cities.\"\n\n\"I was taught about the denial of the right to vote behind the Iron Curtain in Europe; I never knew that there was denial of the right to vote behind a Cotton Curtain here in the United States.\"\n\n- Bob Moses",

When Allen told the U.S. government that he feared for his life, the Justice Department refused to protect him.\n\nAllen had previously tried to register to vote and had allegedly talked to federal officials after witnessing the 1961 murder of Herbert Lee, an NAACP member and volunteer with the SNCC, by E. H. Hurst (1908 - 1990), a white Mississippi state legislator.\n\nAllen watched as Hurst assassinated Lee with a single gunshot to the head and was forced by local police to testify in court that Hurst acted in self-defense (Hurst falsely claimed Lee attacked him a tire iron).\n\nAfter giving this coerced testimony, Allen talked to the FBI and the United States Commission on Civil Rights in Jackson, asking for protection if he testified about how his testimony was made under duress. The Justice Department said they could not offer him protection, and so Allen declined to speak out.\n\nWhen Allen reported receiving death threats, the FBI referred the matter to the office of Amite County Sheriff Daniel Jones. The FBI did so despite an agent acknowledging in a 1961 memo that \"the local sheriff was involved in the plot to kill him\". FBI documentation also noted that Jones was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nFollowing the murder of Herbert Lee, Sheriff Jones began a campaign of harassment against Allen, arresting him on false charges multiple times and breaking his jaw with a flashlight. When Allen filed formal complaints about Jones' behavior, they were ignored.\n\nOn January 31st, 1964, the day before Allen had planned to move out of the state entirely, he was assassinated on his own property. In 2011, the CBS program \"60 Minutes\" conducted a special on his assassination which suggested that Allen was killed by Sheriff Jones. No one has been arrested or prosecuted for his murder.",

During the Spanish Civil War, Hughes traveled there as a correspondent for the Baltimore Afro-American and supported the anti-fascist forces.\n\nAfter being subjected to a secret government interrogation and subsequent televised Senate hearing, led by virulent anti-communist Joseph McCarthy, Hughes distanced himself from radical politics. Biographer Laurie Leach notes that, when selecting works for his Selected Poems (1959), Hughes excluded all his radical socialist verse from the 1930s.\n\nWhen asked why he never joined the Communist Party, Hughes responded \"[My not joining the Communist Party] was based on strict discipline and the acceptance of directives that I, as a writer, did not wish to accept.\"\n\n\"What happens to a dream deferred?\n\nDoes it dry up\n\nLike a raisin in the sun?\n\nOr fester like a sore\u2014\n\nAnd then run?\n\nDoes it stink like rotten meat?\n\nOr crust and sugar over\u2014\n\nlike a syrupy sweet?\n\nMaybe it just sags\n\nlike a heavy load.\n\nOr does it explode?\"\n\n- Langston Hughes, \"Harlem\"",

Two workers were killed, two were sentenced to death, and nine were arrested.\n\nColliers across the Coalbrookdale Coalfields had gone on strike the previous day in response to the lowering of their wages, and production across the area came to a halt. A large body of men marched to ironworks at Madeley Wood and Dawley, blowing out all the furnaces, damaging machinery, and inciting non-striking workers to join in.\n\nBy mid-afternoon the next day, a crowd of 3,000 had gathered at Old Park, near two industrial spoil heaps known as the 'Cinders Hills'. Yeomanry were sent out to disperse the crowd, and they were read the Riot Act and ordered go home. When Yeomanry moved forward to arrest the ringleaders of the strike, they were assaulted by the crowd. After further attempts to control the protesters were frustrated, the Yeomanry fired onto the crowd, killing two.\n\nNine strikers were arrested - two were sentenced to death and the other seven served nine months of hard labor. The initial dispute which had caused the riot was resolved soon after, with some ironmasters agreeing to reduce the daily pay of the workers by 4d instead of 6d.",

Thompson, born on this day in 1924, was an English Marxist historian and communist intellectual known for works such as \"The Making of the English Working Class\" (1963) and \"Time, Work-Discipline, and Industrial Capitalism\" (1967).\n\nThompson was born in Oxford on February 3rd, 1924. His older brother was a British officer in the Second World War, captured and shot while aiding Bulgarian anti-fascist partisans. After his own military service, Thompson studied at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and joined the Communist Party of Great Britain.\n\nIn 1946, Thompson formed the Communist Party Historians Group with Christopher Hill, Eric Hobsbawm, Rodney Hilton, Dona Torr and others. In 1952, they launched the influential journal \"Past and Present\".\n\nThompson is probably best known for his 1963 work \"The Making of the English Working Class\", which focuses on the development of the capitalist-era class system in England. He left the Communist Party after the Soviet invasion of Hungary, but remained committed to communist politics.\n\nThompson became a major figure in the New Left in Britain from the 1960s, becoming a prominent supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and a vociferous left-wing critic of the Labour governments of 1964\u201370 and 1974\u201379.\n\nThompson died in 1993, and his final work, \"Witness Against the Beast\", a biography of poet William Blake, was published posthumously the same year.\n\n\"We must commence to act as if a united, neutral and pacific Europe already exists. We must learn to be loyal, not to 'East' or 'West' but to each other, and we must disregard the prohibitions and limitations imposed by any national state.\"\n\n- E.P. Thompson",

In 1948, he enrolled in Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, South Africa but was expelled after one year there, following the rise of the Apartheid government.\n\nMondlane eventually came to the United States, enrolling at Oberlin College in Ohio at the age of 31 under a Phelps Stokes scholarship, graduating in 1953 with a degree in anthropology and sociology.\n\nMondlane later became an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Syracuse University and helped develop the East African Studies Program there. In 1963, he resigned from his post at Syracuse to move to Tanzania, co-founding the Mozambican Liberation Front (FRELIMO) to fully engage in armed liberation struggle, receiving aid from both the Soviet Union and Maoist China.\n\nIn 1969, Mondlane was assassinated by a bomb planted in a book, sent to him at the FRELIMO Headquarters in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The killing remains unsolved to this day, although former Portuguese agent Oscar Cardoso claims that Casimiro Monteiro planted the bomb. FRELIMO went on to successfully win power and an independent Mozambique in 1975.",

In 1971, Friedan joined other leading feminists to establish the National Women's Political Caucus.\n\nFriedan's politics around feminism were not always intersectional with respect to class and race. Despite the success NOW achieved under her leadership, Friedan's decision to pressure Equal Employment Opportunity to use Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to enforce more job opportunities among American women met with fierce opposition within the organization.\n\nSiding with arguments from the group's black members, many of NOW's leaders accepted that black people below the povery line, both men and women, needed those opportunities more than predominantly white upper class women.\n\nFriedan stepped down as president in 1969 and founded the \"First Women's Bank and Trust Company\" a few years later.\n\n\"The truth is that I've always been a bad-tempered bitch.

During the first two decades of the 20th century, Haywood was involved in several important labor battles, including the Colorado Labor Wars, the Lawrence Textile Strike, and other textile strikes in Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\nHaywood was an advocate of industrial unionism, a labor philosophy that favors organizing all workers in an industry under one union, regardless of the specific trade or skill level. He believed that workers of all ethnicities should be united, and favored direct action over political action.\n\nHaywood was renowned for leading strikes in times of crisis. When martial law was declared during the Lawrence Textile Strike, Haywood traveled to the strike and implemented many innovative tactics to help the workers involved. One such ploy was to conspicuously send the hungry children of striking workers to host families in other states, garnering good press for the working families.\n\nIn 1917, Big Bill Haywood was arrested for espionage, along with 164 other members of the IWW. He was convicted, and, while temporarily released from prison due to an appeal, fled to the Soviet Union, where he served as labor advisor to Vladimir Lenin and spent the rest of life.\n\n\"The mine owners did not find the gold, they did not mine the gold, they did not mill the gold, but by some weird alchemy all the gold belonged to them!\"\n\n- Big Bill Haywood",

According to an 1845 article from The Liberator, first Washington sent a man by the name of Bassett to persuade her to return. They told her they would set her free when she arrived at Mount Vernon, to which she replied \"I am free now, and choose to remain so.\"\n\nBassett would be sent a second time by Washington, with orders to bring her and her infant child by force. New Hampshire Governor John Langdon entertained Bassett while sending word to Judge to flee before midnight. In this way, she successfully evaded Bassett. Washington died soon after, and no subsequent attempts were made to kidnap Judge or her family.\n\nOney later gave an interview in the 1840s, stating that, even fifty years after escaping bondage, she and her child could still be claimed as the legal property of Washington's descendants due to the Fugitive Slave Act. The law also resulted in many black people who had never been enslaved illegally claimed as such, kidnapped, and sold into slavery.\n\nOn June 28th, 1864, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, alongside a similar law in 1850, were repealed by an act of Congress.",

U.S. Congress has called her \"the first lady of civil rights\" and \"the mother of the freedom movement\".\n\nParks was not the first person to resist bus segregation in Montgomery, but the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her bus seat for a white person.\n\nAccording to historian Dr. Casey Nichols, following this arrest, Parks immediately contacted local NAACP president E.D. Nixon and informed him of her arrest. Within hours, the Women\u2019s Political Council (WPC), formed in 1946 to address the grievances of black bus patrons in Montgomery, sprang into action, printing flyers, phoning potential supporters, and organizing carpools.\n\nThe boycott succeeded in 1957 after the Supreme Court declared bus segregation unconstitutional. Parks' act of defiance and the Montgomery bus boycott became important symbols of the movement, and she became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation.\n\nAfter the boycott's conclusion, Parks moved to Detroit, Michigan and began working as an assistant to Detroit Congressman John Conyers. She has received numerous honors, including over 40 honorary degrees, the Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor, and two NAACP image awards. In 2002, Parks produced a biographical film titled \u201cThe Rosa Parks Story.\u201d\n\n\"The only tired I was was tired of giving in.\"\n\n - Rosa Parks",

The anti-slavery Liberty Party was holding its state convention in the city and, when word of the arrest spread, several hundred abolitionists broke into the city jail and freed Jerry.

This and the curbing of labor rights prompted the rest of the workers at La Canadenca to go on strike and demand the readmission of those sacked and wage increases.\n\nThe labor stoppage soon spread to other companies in the sector via the CNT's union for water, gas and electricity workers. The lack of electricity in the city affected transport, hampering the provision of supplies and paralyzing 70% of factories in the province of Barcelona.\n\nA state of war was declared by the government and over 3,000 workers were detained.

On December 5th, 1955, the eve of the anniversary of the death of 19th-century Cuban independence figure Antonio Maceo, soldiers opened fire on Cienfuegos and other students who were returning to Havana university after placing a wreath on Maceo's monument.\n\nCienfuegos credited this incident with his political awakening and decision to dedicate his life to freeing Cuba from Batista's government. Along with Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Juan Almeida Bosque, and Ra\u00fal Castro, he was a member of the 1956 Granma expedition, which launched Fidel Castro's armed insurgency to establish Cuban independence.\n\nOn the evening of October 28th, 1959, Cienfuegos' Cessna 310 ('FAR-53') disappeared over the Straits of Florida during a night flight, returning from Camag\u00fcey to Havana. Despite several days of searching, his plane was not found. By mid-November, Cienfuegos was presumed lost at sea. In 1979, the Cuban government established the \"Order of Cienfuegos\" in his honor.\n\nIn October 1958, when a Cuban Masonic organization expressed concern that someone captured by the rebels might be tortured and killed, Cienfuegos replied:\n\n\"Your petition is unnecessary, because under no condition would we put ourselves at the same moral level as those we are fighting...We cannot torture and assassinate prisoners in the manner of our opponents; we cannot as men of honor and as dignified Cubans use the low and undignified procedures that our opponents use against us.\"",

        "description": "On this day in 1919, a general strike involving ~100,000 workers in Seattle began. Workers, vilified as \"Bolsheviki\", set up an alternative government that distributed 30,000 meals daily and a police force that did not carry weapons.\n\nDissatisfied workers in several unions began the strike to gain higher wages after two years of World War I wage controls. Government officials, the press, and much of the public viewed the strike as a radical attempt to subvert American institutions.\n\nDuring the strike, a cooperative body made up of rank and file workers from all the striking locals was formed, called the General Strike Committee. It acted as a \"virtual counter-government for the city\", according to labor historian Jeremy Brecher.\n\nThe committee organized to provide essential services for the people of Seattle during the work stoppage. A system of food distribution was also established, which distributed as many as 30,000 meals each day.\n\nArmy veterans created an alternative to the police in order to maintain order. A group called the \"Labor War Veteran's Guard\" forbade the use of force and did not carry weapons, using \"persuasion only\". Major General John F. Morrison, stationed in Seattle, claimed that he had never seen \"a city so quiet and orderly.\"\n\nOn February 7th, Mayor Ole Hanson threatened to use 1,500 police and 1,500 troops to replace striking workers the next day, but the strikers assumed this was an empty threat and were proved correct. A few days later, Hanson stated the \"sympathetic strike was called in the exact manner as was the revolution in Petrograd.\"\n\nUnion leadership, including the American Federation of Labor (AFL), began to exert pressure on the General Strike Committee and individual unions to end the strike, causing some locals to return to work.\n\nThe executive committee of the General Strike Committee, pressured by the AFL and international labor organizations, proposed ending the general strike at midnight on February 8th, but their recommendation was voted down by the General Strike Committee.\n\nOn February 10th, the General Strike Committee voted to end the general strike the following day, listing the following reasons: \"Pressure from international officers of unions, from executive committees of unions, from the 'leaders' in the labor movement, even from those very leaders who are still called 'Bolsheviki' by the undiscriminating press. And, added to all these, the pressure upon the workers themselves, not of the loss of their own jobs, but of living in a city so tightly closed.\"\n\nImmediately following the general strike's end, the Socialist Party headquarters was raided by police, and thirty-nine IWW members were arrested as \"ringleaders of anarchy\" despite playing a marginal role in the strike's development.",

        "description": "On this day in 1894, miners in Cripple Creek, Colorado went out on strike to fight against wage cuts. The town was placed under martial law and brutalized by an illegal, mercenary army of deputies who had to be disbanded by state militia.\n\nPrior to the strike, mine owners in Cripple Creek had attempted to expand the 8-hour day at $3.00 a day to a 10-hour day. When miners protested the increased hours, their employers kept the 8-hour day, but at a decreased wage of $2.50 a day.\n\nSoon after these changes were implemented, organized miners became affiliated with the Western Federation of Miners (WFM). After mine owners ignored union president John Calderwood's demands for an 8-hour day at the $3.00 wage, the union struck on February 7th, 1894.\n\nBy the end of February, every smelter in Colorado was either closed or running part-time. When some mines began to hire scab labor, the WFM tried to persuade these men to join the union and strike. When this was unsuccessful, the union drove the scabs out of the area with threats and violence.\n\nAfter miners captured and assaulted six deputies, El Paso County Sheriff M. F. Bowers requested the intervention of the state militia (predecessor to the Colorado National Guard). Finding no apparent disorder on arrival, the state militia left Cripple Creek on March 20th.\n\nAfter miners rejected an offer of $2.75 a day, mine owners secretly met with Sheriff Bowers and struck an agreement to fund a mercenary army of one hundred deputies (later expanded to 1,200) to police the region.\n\nAs word of the owner's militia spread, miners began to arm themselves. Junius J. Johnson, a former U.S. Army officer, was recruited to take over strike operations. He ordered that fortifications be built, a commissary stocked, and the miners drilled in maneuvers.\n\nOn May 24th, strikers seized the Strong mine on Battle Mountain, which overlooked the town of Victor. The next morning, 125 deputies arrived in town. As they marched toward the strikers' camp, workers at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse and steam boiler, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable, causing them to flee the area.\n\nFollowing this incident, Governor Davis Waite issued a proclamation demanding that miners disband their fortifications on Bull Hill and declaring that the force of 1,200 deputies was illegal and to be disbanded.\n\nDespite this, mine owners refused to disband the militia, which seized the town of Cripple Creek and began imprisoning and brutalizing hundreds of people. Owners only broke up the militia after Cripple Creek was re-captured by state forces and Waite threatened to occupy the area for the next thirty days.\n\nThis action was the only time in U.S. history when a state militia was called out in support of striking workers. Following a June agreement to give workers their 8-hour day at a $3.00 wage, more than 300 union members were arrested on a variety of charges. Only four were convicted, but they were quickly pardoned by Governor Waite.\n\nThe WFM became popular following the strike's victory and used its success to organize almost every worker in the Cripple Creek region, including waitresses, laundry workers, bartenders and newsboys, also helping to elect a new sheriff.",

The national protest continued beyond February 7th, however, and a national strike was called on March 28th (incidentally, the same day a million workers in the UK struck to defend their pensions).\n\nHundreds of thousands of workers went on strike, and three million people took to the streets all across the country. Unions were prepared to call another general strike when the French government finally gave in and withdrew the law.\n\nA similar law (the CNE) which applied to small businesses of fewer than 25 people was eventually overturned by the courts in 2007.",

After he met Bernab\u00e9 Buscayno, another former activist who had served in the left-wing Huk Rebellion, they founded the armed wing of the CPP, the NPA. Together, they are referred to as the CPP-NPA.\n\nIn 1970, Sison outlined the CPP-NPA's guiding principles in a book called \"Philippine Society and Revolution\", identifying the Philippines' three major problems as bureaucrat capitalism, feudalism, and U.S. imperialism and advocating the Maoist concept of a protracted people's war to effect change in Filipino society.\n\nThat same year, the Philippine government, led by dictator Ferdinand Marcos, conducted a large military offensive against the CPP-NPA, decimating its ranks.\n\nThe CPP-NPA waged a campaign of guerilla warfare against the Marcos government for decades, and Sison continued to author various texts detailing the theory and practice of the CPP-NPA. In 1976, Buscayno was captured by the state, and Sison himself was captured the following year.\n\nIn 1986, following the People Power Revolution and election of Corazon Aquino, Sison and Buscayno were released. Sison found political refuge in The Netherlands, where he resides today.\n\nSince August 2002, Sison has been classified by the United States as a \"person supporting terrorism\". In 2009, the European Union de-listed him as a \"person supporting terrorism\" and reversed a decision by member governments to freeze his assets.\n\n\"The Filipino communists and masses are confident of winning revolutionary victory because of the ever-worsening crisis of the domestic ruling system as well as that of the world capitalist system. They consider the Philippine revolution as part of the world proletarian revolution and hope that in the coming years and decades the revolutionary struggles will spread and intensify on an unprecedented scale in all continents.\"\n\n- Jose Maria Sison",

        "description": "Louis Auguste Blanqui, born on this day in 1805, was a French socialist and political activist, notable for his revolutionary theory of Blanquism and being the elected president of the Paris Commune while imprisoned.\n\nBlanqui was a non-Marxist socialist who believed in immediate, violent revolution to overturn the capitalist order. Because of his unrelenting radicalism, he spent 33 years of his life in prison, leading to the nickname \"l'enferm\u00e9\", or \"the locked-up one\".\n\nBlanquism is more of a revolutionary theory than an economic or social one; his thinking was chiefly concerned with how to achieve revolution. Unlike Karl Marx, Blanqui did not believe in the predominant role of the working class. Instead, he believed that revolution should be carried out by a small group of professional, dedicated revolutionaries who would establish a temporary dictatorship by force.\n\n\"He who has iron, has bread. People bow down before bayonets; a disarmed crowd is swept aside. But a France bristling with workers in arms means the advent of socialism. In the presence of armed proletarians, all obstacles, resistances and impossibilities will disappear.\"\n\n- Louis Blanqui",

        "description": "On this day in 1912, the city of San Diego banned giving speeches on the street in an attempt to suppress labor organizing efforts by the IWW, leading to a \"Free Speech Fight\" involving more than 5,000 IWW members.\n\nFree Speech Fights were struggles over free speech involving the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in the early 20th century, usually involving civil disobedience and direct action. The IWW members, along with other radical labor groups, were often met with suppression (sometimes violent) from local governments and business leaders when trying to give speeches.\n\nThe San Diego ordinance directly targeted IWW members, whose street \"preaching\" was explicitly made illegal. The law was met with immediate civil disobedience by labor activists, and several were immediately arrested. Over five thousand IWW members came to San Diego to protest the free speech limitation, and the city's jail capacity was strained.\n\nVigilantes began transporting arrested IWW members to the county border and beating them. One city official who opposed the ordinance was threatened with lynching.\n\nPolice indiscriminately used fire hoses on crowds of protesters, including women and children. By the fall of 1912, the protest movement petered out and the Free Speech Fight in San Diego was lost.",

The act declared remaining lands after allotment as \"surplus\" and available for sale, including to non-Natives.\n\nBetween 1887 and 1934, indigenous people lost control of about 100 million acres of land, or about two-thirds of the land base they held in 1887, as a result of the act.\n\nThe loss of land and the break-up of traditional leadership of tribes had such devastating consequences that many scholars refer to the Dawes Act as one of the most destructive U.S. policies for indigenous people in history.",

The high profile attack caught the attention of senior Nazi officials and many Baum Gruppe members, including Marianne and Herbert, were arrested in the following days.\n\nOn August 18th, 1942, Marianne was executed via guillotine by the Nazi state. Her husband Herbert had died a few months earlier, tortured to death in Moabit Prison on June 11th, 1942.

Adopting the pen name \"Raich\u014d\" (\"Thunderbird\"), she began to call for a women's spiritual revolution.\n\nHiratsuka also founded the New Women's Association with fellow women's rights activist Ichikawa Fusae.

The uprising failed and many of its leaders were executed.\n\nThe revolt was planned in advance by the Vi\u1ec7t Nam Qu\u1ed1c D\u00e2n \u0110\u1ea3ng (VNQDD), a socialist party founded by Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e1i H\u1ecdc (shown) that sought independence from France. The VNQDD had previously attempted to engage in clandestine activities to undermine French rule, but increasing state scrutiny on their activities led to their leadership risking a large scale military attack in the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam.\n\nMultiple uprisings were planned throughout the region, with VNQDD members taking command of forces with specific strategic missions. The uprisings were supposed to be simultaneous, but matters were complicated when a messenger carrying an order from H\u1ecdc to delay the uprising until the 15th was arrested.\n\nEarly in the morning of February 10th, 1930, ~50 Vietnamese soldiers stationed at Y\u00ean B\u00e1i attacked their 29 French officers, aided by 60 civilian members of the VNQDD. Although the French were caught off guard and several officers were killed, the majority of the soldiers present remained loyal to the colonial army and helped suppress the uprising. Three Vietnamese sergeants were awarded the M\u00e9daille militaire for their efforts.\n\nLater than evening, another planned VNQDD revolt in the rural district of S\u01a1n D\u01b0\u01a1ng was also suppressed. Although insurgents initially succeeded, raising the VNQDD flag over the town, at sunrise they were routed by the colonial army.\n\nThe French retaliation was swift and brutal. When VNQDD forces fled into the village of Co Am, the French bombed the entire settlement, killing 200 people, mostly civilians. This was the first time that military air power had been used in Indochina.\n\nIn France, the severity of the sentences led to a campaign of solidarity by the French Communist Party and various demonstrations by Vietnamese expatriates. On May 22nd, 1930, more than 1,000 demonstrated outside \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace against the French reaction to Y\u00ean B\u00e1i. The police arrested 47 people, deporting 17 back to Vietnam, where most of them engaged in communist anti-colonial activities.\n\nIn total, 547 individuals, both soldiers and civilians, were prosecuted for their role in the uprising. Thirty-nine of the surviving leaders of the VNQDD were sentenced to death, although some of these were later granted clemency. H\u1ecdc, along with twelve others, was guillotined on June 17th, 1930. The thirteen shouted \"Vietnam!\" in unison before being executed.",

Cannon, born on this day in 1890, was an American Trotskyist and radical labor organizer associated with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP).\n\nOn February 11th, 1890, Cannon was born in Rosedale, Kansas to Irish immigrants with strong socialist convictions. As a young adult, Cannon joined the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in 1908 and the IWW in 1911.\n\nCannon was personally trained by \"Big Bill\" Haywood, a top IWW leader, worked as a labor organizer for the IWW in the American Midwest from 1912-14. In 1919, along with other left luminaries such as Earl Browder, John Reed, and William Bross Lloyd, Cannon co-founded the CPUSA.\n\nWhile in Russia in 1928, Cannon read a critique of the direction of the Communist International written by Leon Trotsky. Convinced of Trotsky's arguments, Cannon attempted to form a Left Opposition within the Communist Party. This resulted in Cannon's expulsion on October 27th, 1928, together with his collaborators Max Shachtman and Martin Abern.\n\nFollowing this incident, Cannon participated in a variety of left factions, co-founding the Communist League and the Workers Party of the United States, also participating in the Socialist Party before finally settling on the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in 1938.\n\nCannon was a leading figure in the Fourth International, the international Trotskyist movement, visiting Britain in 1938 with the intention of aiding the unification of the competing British groups.\n\nAn opponent of America's involvement in the Second World War, Cannon was arrested under the Alien Registration Act in 1941. Cannon served as national secretary of the Socialist Workers Party until 1953, retiring in California.\n\nAmong Cannon's works are \"Struggle for a Proletarian Party\" (1943), \"History of American Trotskyism\" (1944), \"America's Road to Socialism\" (1953) and \"Speeches for Socialism\" (1971).\n\n\"The workers of America have power enough to topple the structure of capitalism at home and to lift the whole world with them when they rise.\"\n\n- James P.

In 1982, he began volunteering with the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard, supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and joined the Young Communist League, later serving as its general secretary.\n\nIn 1984, with his friend Mike Jackson, Ashton co-founded the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM) support group after the two men collected donations for striking miners at the London Lesbian and Gay Pride march that year.\n\nDiagnosed with HIV/AIDS, Ashton was admitted to Guy's Hospital on January 30th, 1987 and died 12 days later of Pneumocystis pneumonia. His death prompted a significant response from the gay community, particularly in publication and attendance at his funeral at Lambeth Cemetery.\n\nThe LGSM's activities were dramatized in the 2014 film \"Pride\", however the film completely omitted Ashton's participation in the Communist Party.\n\n\"I had to question the morals and the ideas that society had put there for me to follow.

        "description": "On this day in 2004, the first store was looted in a series of riots and protests by unemployed people in Slovakia. Although the protests were brutally suppressed by police, the government subsequently increased activation benefits by 50%.\n\nThe protests were in response to welfare cuts by the Slovakian government. Many Roma people participated in the protests. At the time, 51% of Roma women and 72% of Roma men were unemployed, a trend which can be traced back to liberalization policies after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn February 2004, unemployed workers all over Slovakia received official notices from the government informing them of steep cuts to welfare benefits, and demonstrations broke out in the eastern parts of the country.\n\nThe reaction was a mix of peaceful demonstrations and outright rioting. Signs from protests read \"We want work, not food stamps\" and \"We've had enough of capitalism\", and were attended by some of the white ethnic majority.\n\nIn the largest police and military operation since 1989, over 2,000 troops were mobilized and sent to the affected regions. On February 23rd, in Trebi\u0161ov (southeastern Slovakia), police attacked a Roma demonstration with teargas and, in the freezing February cold, water cannons.\n\nEarly the next morning, around 240 policemen attacked a settlement the protesters were suspected to live in by about 80 people in the historical town of Levo\u010da.\n\nAlthough the protests failed to develop into a more substantive political movement, they had a lasting impact. Soon afterward, the government made important concessions, increasing activation benefits by 50%, introducing scholarships and various subsidies for pupils and students from poor families, and increasing funding for placement opportunities for the unemployed.",

        "description": "Virgilia D'Andrea, born on this day in 1888, was an anarchist activist and poet whose writings were suppressed by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.\n\nD'Andrea was politicized by the bloodshed of World War I and left teaching to join the movement against Italian participation in the war. By 1917, the state had deemed her an effective and dangerous radical anti-war agitator. Following Italy's entry into the war, both D'Andrea and her partner Armando Borghi were subjected to house arrest and legally confined for the duration of the war.\n\nIn 1922, she published her first book of poetry, \"Tormento\", which included a forward by Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta. A prominent free love advocate and noted anti-fascist, she fled Italy with the rise of fascism and emigrated to the United States.\n\nIn 1929, a second edition of \"Tormento\" was published, however the prints were immediately seized by the Italian government. Citing her outspoken advocacy of free love, Italian authorities charged D'Andrea with \"reprehensible moral behavior\" and asserted that she was committed to violence, with her verses \"carefully composed to instigate lawbreaking, to incite class hatred, and to vilify the army.\"\n\nD'Andrea died of breast cancer in New York City on May 12th, 1933, aged 45. A collection of writings \"Torce nella Notte\" (English: \"Torches in the Night\") was published in New York shortly after D'Andrea's death.",

Graeber stated that he had been an anarchist since at least the age of 16.\n\nAside from his scholarship, Graeber was active in the Global Justice movement, also playing an early and influential role in the Occupy Wall Street protests. Graeber is sometimes attributed to coining the phrase \"We are the 99%\", however he credited the slogan to on-scene collaboration.\n\n\"Most of all, anarchism is just a matter of having the courage to take the simple principles of common decency that we all live by, and to follow them through to their logical conclusions.\"\n\n- David Graeber",

There were also rumors that only four weeks' worth of flour were left.\n\nAt the meeting, an orator initiated the riot by saying this to the gathered crowd: \"Fellow citizens! Mr. Hart has now 53,000 barrels of flour in his store; let us go and offer him eight dollars a barrel, and if he does not take it...\"\n\nHungry workers plundered private storerooms filled with sacks of hoarded flour, and forty were arrested.

        "description": "On this day in 1989, while eating with his family, Irish criminal defense lawyer Pat Finucane was assassinated by loyalist forces acting in collusion with the British government. No members of British state security have been prosecuted.\n\nPatrick Finucane was born on March 21st, 1949 to a prominent Republican family in Belfast. Three of his brothers were Irish Republican Army (IRA) members, two of whom would be imprisoned by the British government.\n\nFinucane himself was a criminal defense lawyer. Although he had represented both Republicans and loyalists, Finucane's most notable client was likely Bobby Sands, a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) who died on hunger strike while imprisoned at HM Prison Maze in Northern Ireland.\n\nOn February 12th, 1989, while eating a Sunday meal at home with his wife and three children, Finucane was shot fourteen times by two gunmen. Twelve shots were to his face. The loyalist paramilitary Ulster Defence Association took credit for his murder, alleging without evidence that Finucane was a high-ranking member of the IRA.\n\nFollowing a 2001 peace agreement, the British government promised to consider opening an inquiry into Finucane's death, appointing an international judge to review his case. The government declined to open an inquiry, however, after the judge found evidence of state collusion.\n\nIn 2004, Ken Barrett, a member of the Ulster Defence Association, pled guilty to Finucane's murder. The identity of the second gunman remains unknown.\n\nIn 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron met with Pat Finucane's family and admitted to state collusion in his assassination, but as of February 2022 no member of the British security services has been prosecuted.\n\nOn November 30th, 2020, Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland Secretary, rejected calls for a public inquiry into Finucane's killing.",

        "description": "Aung San, born on this day in 1915, was a Burmese revolutionary nationalist who was instrumental in helping Burma achieve independence from British imperialists, however he was assassinated six months before independence was formalized.\n\nAung San was born to a family distinguished in the resistance movement after the British annexation of 1886. He enrolled in Rangoon University in 1933 and became secretary of the university's student union and and editor of its newspaper.\n\nIn 1936, Aung San was expelled for refusing to reveal the name of an author for the paper who had criticized a university official. In response, students went on strike, leading to his reinstatement. The incident garnered nationwide publicity and recognition for Aung San.\n\nIn 1938, Aung San joined the Thakins, a movement of nationalist intellectuals who rejected British rule. In 1939, he became a founding member and the first Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Burma, however he had a unsteady relationship with the Party, joining and leaving it twice.\n\nIn 1940, Aung San was contacted by Japanese agents, who offered assistance to help him raise an army to fight against British rule. On December 28th, 1941, Aung San, as part of the \"Thirty Comrades\", formally inaugurated the Burma Independence Army (BIA) in Bangkok.\n\nThe BIA initially collaborated with Japanese forces following their invasion of the country in 1942 and establishment of a puppet government. However, relations between the BIA and Japan soon deteriorated, and Aung San grew suspicious of Japan's true intentions in the region.\n\nAung San began to secretly organize against the Japanese occupation, founding the \"Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League\" (AFPL) in 1944. On March 27th, 1945, Aung San led a surprise attack against Japanese forces, continuing to fight them for the remainder of World War II.\n\nFollowing the end of war and official alignment with Allied forces, British forces sought to integrate the Burma National Army into the colonial armed forces. Aung San, who was not personally invited to negotiate by the British, reorganized former soldiers as the paramilitary \"People's Volunteer Organization\" in an attempt to preserve an armed, nationalist formation.\n\nClement Attlee's newly-elected Labour Party government in the United Kingdom decided to start moving towards a withdrawal, and, beginning in September 1946, Aung San served as Premier of the Crown Colony of Burma, a move criticized by the Communist Party. On January 27th, 1947, Aung and Attlee signed an agreement on the terms of independence within the year.\n\nOn July 19th, before the transition to independence had been completed, Aung San was assassinated along with seven other members of the interim government under unclear circumstances.\n\nU Saw, a political rival, was later executed for his role in the killings, although there have been allegations made regarding British complicity in the incident.\n\n\"If you're feeling helpless, help someone.\"\n\n- Aung San",

        "description": "T-Bone Slim, born on this day in 1880, was an IWW member, working class songwriter, and author. Due to his popular, labor themed tunes, Slim was dubbed the \"laureate of the logging camps\".\n\nBorn Matti Valentin Huhta to Finnish immigrant parents in Ashtabula, Ohio, Slim became an itinerant worker after leaving his wife and family in 1912. It isn't known when Slim became a Wobbly, a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), but he first appeared in the IWW's press in the 1920 edition of the IWW Songbook.\n\nSlim became one of the IWW's most famous writers during the 1920s and 30s, and many people would buy the \"Industrial Worker\" just to read his articles - one ad from the paper read \"there's a lot more in Industrial Solidarity and Industrial Worker than T-Bone Slim's columns\".\n\nSlim did not presume his working-class readership to be unintelligent people, making use of complex wordplay and experimental writing techniques, playing with ambiguity, satire and surrealism.\n\nSlim was also well-known for his songs, such as the \"Lumberjack's Prayer\", a parody of the Lord's Prayer about the poor quality of food available for the working class, and \"The Popular Wobbly\", which experienced a revival among civil rights activists during the 1960s.\n\nIn spite of his renown in radical circles during his lifetime, many details of Slim's life remain unclear. During the mid-1930s, he settled in New York City, where he worked as a barge captain on the docks.\n\nIn May 1942, Slim's body was found in the East River. His cause of death remains unknown and has been subject to speculation. Following his death, Slim largely faded into obscurity, especially compared to more famous IWW-associated writers such as Joe Hill.\n\nSlim's songs have been preserved, however, re-published in editions of the Little Red Songbook and covered by musicians such as Pete Seeger, Utah Phillips, and his own great-grandnephew, John Westmoreland.\n\nUntil recently, there was thought to be no surviving photographs of Slim, however, in 2019 two photos were discovered and published by Working Class History in a Newberry Library collection.",

Vel\u00e1squez led his first strike at age 12.\n\nWhen he was just four years old, Vel\u00e1squez began assisting his parents, migrant farm workers, in the fields. They rode with other migrant workers in a pickup truck with a canvas-covered bed, huddling around a can of hot ashes and covering themselves in blankets to stay warm. Vel\u00e1squez led his first strike at the age of 12, helping pickers at his summer job win better wages.\n\nIn September 1967, Baldemar co-founded FLOC with his father to help migrant workers collectively bargain for better conditions. Through FLOC, Vel\u00e1squez helped organize strikes and a boycott against the Campbell Soup Company, as well as leading migrant workers on a 560 mile protest march from the union headquarters in Toledo, Ohio to Campbell's headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.\n\nAfter winning a collective bargaining agreement with Campbell's, growers began complaining that they could not compete with inexpensive Mexican produce. Vel\u00e1squez personally traveled to Mexico and successfully lobbied the Mexican unions to raise their wages and benefits, closing the gap in prices.\n\nIn 1994, Vel\u00e1squez was awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle, the highest honor Mexico can bestow on a non-citizen.\n\n\"We can just lay down and let matters overwhelm us and whine and complain about how bad things are, or get up and do something and start speaking to those things that are upon you and those things that are evil...Just do it and don\u2019t stop, and whatever happens happens\u2026 As Emiliano Zapata said, it\u2019s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.\"\n\n- Baldemar Vel\u00e1squez",

One of the main grievances of the convicts was their inability to voice complaints about brutality from the prison guards.\n\nPrison authorities claimed that the strike was a failure and that there was only a \"sick call\" only slightly larger than normal, however reports from prisoners themselves indicated more than seven hundred went on strike the first day.\n\nThe strike quickly grew in proportion - just a few days after it began, more than 80% of the prison population were refusing to work.\n\nThe prison warden declared a \"general lockup\", which confined all prisoners to their cells, and claimed the strike was over. Despite this, the prisoners considered their protest a victory, as prison work had successfully been stopped, and without the violence of other prison uprisings.",

Anthony, born on this day in 1820, was an American abolitionist and women's rights activist who played a pivotal role in the women's suffrage movement.\n\nBorn into a Quaker family committed to social equality, she collected anti-slavery petitions at the age of 17. In 1863, she, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, founded the Women's Loyal National League, which conducted the largest petition drive in United States history up to that time, collecting nearly 400,000 signatures in support of the abolition of slavery. In 1866, they founded the American Equal Rights Association, which campaigned against gender and racial discrimination.\n\nIn 1872, Anthony was arrested for voting in her hometown of Rochester, New York, and convicted of violating the Enforcement Act in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, authorities declined to take further action.\n\nIn 1878, Anthony and Stanton arranged for Congress to be presented with an amendment giving women the right to vote. In 1920, it was ratified as the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, colloquially known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.\n\n\"'Organize, agitate, educate' must be our war cry.\"\n\n- Susan B.

Truman did not respond, and the U.S. began meddling in Vietnamese affairs to undermine Ho Chi Minh's movement. Here is an excerpt from the letter:\n\n\"Our Vietnam people, as early as 1941, stood by the Allies' side and fought against the Japanese and their associates, the French colonialists. From 1941 to 1945 we fought bitterly, sustained by the patriotism of our fellow-countrymen and by the promises made by the Allies at [the summits in] Yalta, San Francisco and Potsdam.\n\n...The French aggression on a peace-loving people is a direct menace to world security. It implies the complicity, or at least, the connivance of the Great Democracies. The United Nations ought to keep their words. They ought to interfere to stop this unjust war, and to show that they mean to carry out in peace-time the principles for which they fought in war-time.\n\n...It is with this firm conviction that we request of the United States as guardians and champions of World Justice to take a decisive step in support of our independence. What we ask has been graciously granted to the Philippines. Like the Philippines our goal is full independence and full cooperation with the United States. We will do our best to make this independence and cooperation profitable to the whole world.\"",

Newton also co-founded the Black Panther newspaper service which became one of America's most widely distributed black newspapers.\n\nIn 1967, he was involved in a shootout which led to the death of the police officer John Frey. Although arrested for the murder of Frey, the charges were eventually dismissed, following a massive \"Free Huey!\" campaign.\n\nDespite graduating from high school illiterate, he taught himself how to read by reading Plato's Republic, later earning a PhD. in social philosophy from the University of California at Santa Cruz's History of Consciousness program in 1980. In 1989, he was murdered in Oakland, California by Tyrone Robinson, a member of the Black Guerrilla Family.\n\n\"Black Power is giving power to people who have not had power to determine their destiny.\"\n\n- Huey Newton",

        "description": "Audre Lorde, born on this day in 1934, was a queer feminist author and socialist activist. Among her works are \"The Black Unicorn\" and \"Your Silence Will Not Protect You: Essays and Poems\".\n\nLorde was born in New York City to Caribbean immigrants - a father from Barbados and Grenadian mother. She took an interest in poetry and reading at an early age; when asked how she was feeling, Lorde would often respond by reciting a memorized poem.\n\nLorde attended Hunter College in New York, graduating in 1959. While there, she worked as a librarian and became an active participant in the gay culture of Greenwich Village.\n\nIn 1961, Lorde earned a master's degree in library science from Columbia University. During this period, she worked as a public librarian in nearby Mount Vernon, New York, authored poetry, and participated in civil rights demonstrations.\n\nIn 1984, Lorde started a visiting professorship in West Berlin at the Free University of Berlin. During her time in Germany, Lorde became an influential part of the nascent Afro-German movement. Together with a group of black women activists in Berlin, Audre Lorde coined the term \"Afro-German\" and became a mentor to a number of women, including May Ayim, Ika H\u00fcgel-Marshall, and Helga Emde.\n\nLorde's thinking was emphatically intersectional, criticizing, in her words, \"racism, the belief in the inherent superiority of one race over all others and thereby the right to dominance. Sexism, the belief in the inherent superiority of one sex over the other and thereby the right to dominance. Ageism. Heterosexism. Elitism. Classism.\"\n\nOf non-intersectional feminism in the U.S., Lorde famously said \"Those of us who stand outside the circle of this society's definition of acceptable women; those of us who have been forged in the crucibles of difference -- those of us who are poor, who are lesbians, who are Black, who are older -- know that survival is not an academic skill. It is learning how to take our differences and make them strengths. For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master's house as their only source of support.\"\n\n\"Without community, there is no liberation.\"\n\n- Audre lorde",

As a young man, he served in the Spanish military, but deserted, fleeing to France in 1954 after ransacking a warehouse that belonged to his company.\n\nAfter moving to Paris, Urtubia was asked to hide a member of the Maquis, Spanish guerrillas who opposed Franco from exile, in his house. The refugee in this case turned out to be legendary anti-fascist Francesc Sabat\u00e9 Llopart, one of the two Sabat\u00e9 brothers.\n\nUrtubia's anti-fascist actions continued as he learned how to forge government documents and currency, using these skills to aid left-wing movements around the world. One of the most dramatic examples took place in 1977, when he forged $20 million dollars worth of Citibank traveler's checks, money which went to aid left-wing guerillas in Latin America.\n\n\"We are bricklayers, painters, electricians - we do not need the state for anything.

Her father had moved to the integrated town in order to flee white supremacist violence in Georgia. When Morrison was two years old, her landlord set the family's home on fire while they were inside because they could not pay their rent.\n\nMorrison graduated from both Howard and Cornell University, earning a B.A. in English and Master of Arts respectively. After working for several years as an English professor, Morrison was hired as an editor by Random House in New York City, where she became their first black woman senior editor in the fiction department.\n\nIn this capacity, Morrison worked to bring black literature into the mainstream, editing and promoting the writing of authors such as Angela Davis, Huey Newton, Muhammad Ali, Toni Cade Bambara, Henry Dumas, Nigerian writers Wole Soyinka and Chinua Achebe, and South African playwright Athol Fugard.\n\nIn 1970, Morrison's novel \"The Bluest Eye\" was published to popular acclaim. Other works by Morrison include \"Beloved\" (1987), for which she won the Pulitzer Prize, and \"Song of Solomon\" (1977).\n\nIn 2008, Morrison endorsed Barack Obama in his campaign for the American presidency. When Obama won, Morrison said she felt like an American for the first time, and that \"I felt very powerfully patriotic when I went to the inauguration of Barack Obama. I felt like a kid.\"\n\n\"Freeing yourself was one thing, claiming ownership of that freed self was another.\"\n\n- Toni Morrison",

The phrase \"feminine mystique\" was created by Friedan to illustrate the assumptions that women would be fulfilled from their housework, marriage, sexual lives, and children. Friedan sought to prove that housewives were unsatisfied but could not voice their feelings.\n\nDespite the importance of the book in feminist history, it has faced numerous criticisms. According to Kirsten Fermaglich and Lisa Fine, \"women of color - African American, Latina, Asian American and Native American women - were completely absent from Friedan's vision, as were white working-class and poor women.\"  \n\nProfessor Lindsey Churchill wrote that bell hooks found Friedan\u2019s manifesto both racist and classist, not at all applicable to African Americans and other working-class women who joined the labor force from necessity.",

By declaring wide swaths of domestic territory as \"military zones\", the American government provided legal justification for forcibly removing people deemed a threat from them.\n\nUsing a broad interpretation of Executive Order 9066, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt issued orders declaring areas of the western United States as zones of exclusion under the Executive Order. As a result, approximately 112,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry were evicted from the West Coast of the United States and held in American concentration camps and other \"confinement sites\" across the country.\n\nAmericans of Italian and German ancestry were also targeted by these restrictions, including internment. 11,000 people of German ancestry were interned, as were 3,000 people of Italian ancestry, along with some Jewish refugees.\n\nIt wasn't until 1990 that surviving internees began to receive individual redress payments and a letter of apology.",

Immediately after the firings, the union leadership ordered the strike, taking their respective trolley cars off the streets effective at 1:00 that afternoon.\n\nDuring the strike, workers destroyed trolley property. A crowd of 2,000 seized a trolley and set it on fire. Another crowd of 5,000 seized a crew working a trolley and beat them in the street. A bomb threat in Germantown was disregarded until dynamite was loaded onto the tracks by 2,000 workers.\n\nDespite the union threatening a general strike if strike breakers were brought in, RTC brought in 600 strike breakers while simultaneously denying that they had done so.\n\nWhen the National Guard entered Philadelphia to provide protection for RTC, members of other unions saw this as a clear signal that the city and state governments were uniting in favor of the companies against the unions, and the entire city began a general strike.\n\nThe general strike began on March 5th, 1910 with 60,000-75,000 workers, but grew to more than 140,000 over the following weeks. During the strike, Philadelphia police arrested high-ranking union organizers and sympathy strikers, half of whom were under eighteen.\n\nNewspapers reported violence and sabotage that rendered streetcars inoperable, as well as retaliation by strikebreakers who shot into crowds and killed several bystanders with trolleys. Approximately ten strikers and bystanders were killed by gunfire from strikebreakers and police.\n\nThe general strike ended on March 27th, however streetcar workers remained on strike until April 19th. After nine weeks of the strike, costing RTC $2,395,000 and the city government millions, RTC agreed to a wage increase, the re-hiring of strikers within three months, and mediation of the initial 173 union-targeted firings.",

Workers had planned to seize control of rail links between the cities, paralyzing the country's transport links.\n\nDue to the lack of instantaneous communication at the time, revolutionaries were unaware that their compatriots in the other cities had been arrested before they crossed the Paran\u00e1 River from Argentina into the city on February 20th.\n\nDespite this setback, 150 revolutionaries, among them notable communists Oscar Creydt, Marcos Kanner, and F\u00e9lix Cantalicio Aracuy\u00fa, successfully held the commune in Encarnaci\u00f3n for sixteen hours before it was recaptured by the state.\n\nMany rebels successfully managed to flee, using two seized steamboats to travel towards Brazil, attacking \"yerba mate\" plantations and burning records of indentured servitude along the way. Seventeen who were unable to flee were arrested and subject to torture and incarceration.\n\nIn 1985, Paraguayan researcher Fernando Quesada published a book about the uprising, titled \"1931, la toma de Encarnaci\u00f3n\".",

        "description": "Augusto C. Sandino, assassinated on this day in 1934, was a Nicaraguan revolutionary and leader of a rebellion between 1927 and 1933 against the U.S. military occupation of Nicaragua.\n\nAlthough derisively called a \"bandit\" by the U.S. government, Sandino's guerilla style warfare against U.S. forces made him a hero throughout much of Latin America, where he became a symbol of resistance to U.S. imperialism.\n\nOn this day in 1934, Sandino attended a round of talks with Sacasa, the Nicaraguan President. On leaving Sacasa's Presidential Palace, Sandino and five others were stopped in their car at the main gate by local National Guardsmen and were ordered to leave their car.\n\nOn orders from National Guard leader Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda, these men took Sandino, his brother Socrates, and his two generals to a crossroads section in Larreynaga and summarily executed them.\n\nSandino has been cited as an influence by many Latin American revolutionaries and organizations, including Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the Nicaraguan Sandinista National Liberation Front, and the Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN) in El Salvador.\n\n\"Come, morphine addicts, come and kill us in our own land. I await you before my patriotic soldiers, feet firmly set, not worried about how many of you there may be. But keep in mind that when this happens the Capitol Building in Washington will shake with the destruction of your greatness, and our blood will redden the white doom of your famous White House, the cavern where you concoct your crimes.\"\n\n- August Sandino",

        "description": "Claudia Jones, born on this day in 1915, was a communist author, activist, and journalist active in the United States and Great Britain. She was imprisoned and deported by the U.S. for violating the anti-communist McCarran and Smith Acts.\n\nBorn in the British colony of Trinidad as Claudia Vera Cumberbatch, she later adopted the name Jones as \"self-protective disinformation\". She came to the U.S. as a child when her family migrated to Harlem.\n\nGrowing up working poor had a lasting impact on Jones; her mother died when she was twelve from work-related exhaustion and she herself caught tuberculosis at the age of 17 from poor living conditions, leading to lifelong lung damage.\n\nIn 1936, Jones joined the Young Communist League USA to help support the Scottsboro Boys, a group of young black men being subjected to a legalized form of lynching in the American South. Jones became a prominent author within the organization, editing its monthly journal \"Spotlight\".\n\nAs a member of the Communist Party USA and a feminist black nationalist, Jones' main focus was on creating \"an anti-imperialist coalition, managed by working-class leadership, fueled by the involvement of women\", and championed women's causes inside the Party.\n\nOne of Jones' best known works is the 1949 piece \"An End to the Neglect of the Problems of the Negro Woman!\". In the work, Jones shows an understanding of what would later be called \"intersectionality\", writing: \"The bourgeoisie is fearful of the militancy of the Negro woman, and for good reason. The capitalists know, far better than many progressives seem to know, that once Negro women begin to take action, the militancy of the whole Negro people, and thus of the anti-imperialist coalition, is greatly enhanced.\"\n\nFollowing a hearing by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Jones was found in violation of the McCarran Act for being an \"alien\" (a non-citizen) who had joined the Communist Party, despite the fact that she had identified herself as a party member when completing her Alien Registration in 1940. She was ordered to be deported in 1950.\n\nBefore Jones could be deported, however, she was tried and convicted with eleven others, including her friend and communist of note Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, of \"un-American activities\" under the anti-communist Smith Act.\n\nAfter serving several years in prison, Jones was released in 1955 and deported to the United Kingdom on December 7th that year. She immediately joined the Communist Party of Great Britain upon her arrival in Britain and remained a member until her death.\n\nJones continued her activism in Britain, campaigning against racism and sexism, speaking at trade union rallies, and visiting China, meeting with Mao Zedong. In 1958, Jones founded the West Indian Gazette, Britain's first major black newspaper, and helped organize celebrations of Caribbean culture that became the annual Notting Hill Carnival.\n\nJones died in 1964 at the age of 49. She is buried next to Karl Marx in Highgate Cemetery, North London.\n\n\"It was out of my Jim Crow experiences as a young negro woman, experiences likewise born of working-class poverty that led me to join the Young Communist League and to choose the philosophy of my life, the science of Marxism-Leninism - that philosophy not only rejects racist ideas, but is the antithesis of them.\"\n\n- Claudia Jones",

Eisner became a martyr and a Bavarian Soviet Republic was declared just a few months later.\n\nKurt Eisner, born to a Jewish family in Berlin, was a revolutionary German socialist, radical journalist, and theater critic. Before leading the People's State of Bavaria, he worked as a journalist in Marburg, Nuremberg, and Munich. In the early 1890s, Eisner served nine months in prison for writing an article that attacked Kaiser Wilhelm II.\n\nIn 1918, Eisner was convicted of treason for his role in inciting a strike of munitions workers. He spent nine months in Cell 70 of Stadelheim Prison, but was released during the General Amnesty in October of that year.\n\nFollowing his release from prison, Eisner helped organize the revolution that overthrew the Bavarian monarchy, declaring Bavaria to be a free state and republic. Despite Eisner's socialist politics, he explicitly distanced the movement from the Bolsheviks and promised to uphold property rights.\n\nOn February 21st, 1919, while on his way to deliver his resignation to Parliament, Eisner was assassinated in Munich by a far-right German nationalist. Eisner's murder made him a martyr for left-wing causes, and a period of lawlessness in Bavaria followed his death.\n\nOn the night of April 6th-7th, 1919, communists, encouraged by the news of the communist revolution in Hungary, declared a Soviet Republic, with Ernst Toller as chief of state. The Bavarian Soviet Republic was crushed by the right-wing German Freikorps.\n\nSome of the military leaders of the Freikorps, including Rudolf Hess and Franz Ritter von Epp, would go on to become powerful figures in the Nazi Party. Ironically, Adolf Hitler himself marched in the funeral procession for Eisner, a Jew, wearing a red armband as a display of sympathy.\n\n\"Truth is the greatest of all national possessions. A state, a people, a system which suppresses the truth or fears to publish it, deserves to collapse.\"\n\n- Kurt Eisner",

He is best known for militant advocacy of black liberation and time spent as a vocal spokesman for the Nation of Islam.\n\nMalcolm's policy of endorsing violent self-defense (i.e., achieving liberation \"by any means necessary\") and opposition to integration stood in stark contrast to his contemporary Martin Luther King Jr., whom Malcolm referred to as a \"chump\".\n\nOn this day in 1965, he was preparing to address the Organization of Afro-American Unity in Manhattan's Audubon Ballroom when a quarrel broke out. A man rushed forward and shot him once in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun and two other men charged the stage firing semi-automatic handguns.\n\nMalcolm X was pronounced dead at 3:30 pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The gunmen, identified as members of Nation of Islam, were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Two of these men were exonerated on November 18th, 2021.\n\nDespite the conviction of these three men, allegations of conspiracy surround Malcolm's death, including the complicity of the New York Police Department and involvement of Louis Farrakhan, a leader within the Nation of Islam at the time of Malcolm's death.\n\nEarl Grant, one of Malcolm X's associates who was present at the assassination, wrote: \"About five minutes later, a most incredible scene took place. Into the hall sauntered about a dozen policemen. They were strolling at about the pace one would expect of them if they were patrolling a quiet park...Here were New York City policemen, entering a room from which at least a dozen shots had been heard, and yet not one of them had his gun out!...some of them even had their hands in their pockets.\n\nJournalist Louis Lomax wrote that John Ali, national secretary of the Nation of Islam, was a former FBI agent. Malcolm X had confided to a reporter that Ali was his \"archenemy\" within the Nation of Islam leadership. Lomax notes that Ali had a meeting with Talmadge Hayer, one of the men convicted of killing Malcolm and the only one not exonerated later, the night before the assassination.\n\n\"We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, my brothers and sisters\u2014Plymouth Rock landed on us.\"\n\n- Malcolm X",

        "description": "Nina Simone, born on this day in 1933, was an American singer, pianist, composer, and civil rights activist, known for songs such as \"Mississippi Goddam\" and \"Four Women\".\n\nSimone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon to a working class family in Tryon, North Carolina on February 21st, 1933. Showing prodigious musical talent at a young age, at twelve years old, she refused to perform at her first classical recital until her parents were allowed to sit in the front of the recital hall.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, Simone made a living as musician and singer in the U.S., teaching, playing, and singing. Although Simone was and is often categorized as a jazz musician, she dismissed the term, saying \"To most white people, jazz means black and jazz means dirt, and that's not what I play. I play black classical music.\"\n\nFollowing the white supremacist murders of Medgar Evers and four young black girls in the Birmingham Church Bombing of 1963, she released \"Nina Simone in Concert\", an album which contained the song \"Mississippi Goddam\", raging explicitly against racism in the U.S.\n\nMississippi Goddam, which Simone stated was \"like throwing ten bullets back at them\", was boycotted in some southern regions, and copies of the album were smashed and mailed back to her record distributor. Undeterred, Simone continued to be overtly political in her music, authoring \"Old Jim Crow\" and performing songs such as \"Strange Fruit\" and \"Backlash Blues\", written by Langston Hughes.\n\nSimone left the U.S. for Barbados in September 1970, living in London and the Netherlands before finally settling in France. In 2003, she passed away in Carry-le-Rouet.\n\n\"It was always Marx, Lenin, and revolution - real girl's talk.\"\n\n- Nina Simone, on conversations with playwright Lorraine Hansberry",

Among the reforms the Second Republic passed were universal male suffrage and a guaranteed \"right to work\", provided by National Workshops which gave the unemployed with a source of income.\n\nThe protests of February 22nd were triggered by the banning of political banquets, legal means of criticizing the government and fundraising for political organizing. Incidentally, communist journalist Friedrich Engels was in Paris at the time and witnessed these banquets. After the ban, thousands flooded out onto the streets to protest against the \"Citizen King\" Louis Philippe and his chief minister Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Guillaume Guizot.\n\nShouting \"Down with Guizot\" and \"Long Live the Reform\", the crowds marched past Guizot's residence and erected barricades in the streets of Paris, where fighting broke out between the citizens and the Parisian municipal guards. French troops shot into the crowd, killing at least fifty-two people.\n\nIn the next few days, Guizot resigned and King Philippe fled the country. By February 26th, the Second Republic had been formed, with poet Alphonse de Lamartine acting as a de facto dictator over France for the next three months.\n\nThe Second Republic's governance would be tested in the \"June Days\" uprising, which Karl Marx identified as a conflict between petite bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The revolting workers were crushed by force (with over 4,000 insurgents being deported to Algeria) and the Second Republic continued until elected President Louis Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte dissolved the parliament in a coup in 1851.",

        "description": "On this day in 1974, Sam Lovejoy, an anti-nuclear activist, sabotaged a 500 foot weather tower near Montague, Massachusetts to protest a local nuclear power site. The tower had been built by Northeast Utilities to test wind direction so that authorities would know which way the radiation would blow from the plant in case of an accident.\n\nUsing a few simple farm tools to loosen the turnbuckles in the stays of the tower, Lovejoy left behind him 349 feet of twisted wreckage. At Lovejoy's trial, historian Howard Zinn was brought in as an expert witness on civil disobedience. Zinn testified that Lovejoy's act was in the best tradition of activists like Gandhi and Henry David Thoreau.\n\nLovejoy was found not guilty, and the destruction of the tower and trial brought national attention to the anti-nuclear cause.",

The union continued to fight for worker rights for several years afterward.\n\nThe union was formed under the leadership of Kate Mullany, a 23-year old Irish immigrant. Kate was employed as a laundress in Troy, New York. Working conditions were particularly brutal - workers were expected to work 12 to 14 hours a day in dangerous conditions due to scalding hot water.\n\nOn February 23rd, 1864, shortly after forming the union, approximately 300 women went on strike from all fourteen commercial laundry establishments in Troy. That afternoon, Kate met with the women to discuss their demands for a 20-25% wage increase and concerns about the boiling water.\n\nAfter just six days, workers won their demands. The female laundresses had been assisted by the male Iron Molders' Union No. 2, and the laundresses showed their appreciation in a picnic, attended by more than 4,000.\n\nKate Mullany and the Collar Laundry Union continued to agitate for better pay and working conditions, going on multiple strikes in the following years. The Collar Laundry Union also formed a cooperative to sidestep negotiating with capitalist employers, however their venture failed.\n\nMullany would go to become the first woman to hold a national labor position, serving as the assistant secretary of the National Labor Union.",

Du Bois, born on this day in 1868, was a seminal American intellectual and socialist civil rights activist who co-founded both the Niagara Movement and the NAACP, also authoring texts such as \"Black Reconstruction in America\".\n\nDu Bois grew up in the relatively tolerant and integrated community of Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and, after completing graduate work at the University of Berlin and Harvard, he became a professor of history, sociology, and economics at Atlanta University in Georgia.\n\nAmong Du Bois's works are \"The Souls of Black Folk\", a collection of essays, and \"Black Reconstruction in America\", which challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that black people were responsible for the failures of the Reconstruction Era. Du Bois was also a Pan-Africanist and helped organize several Pan-African Congresses to fight for the independence of African colonies from European powers.\n\nLater in life, Du Bois was openly sympathetic to communist movements. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began to keep a file on Du Bois in 1942, and, during the anti-communist hysteria of the McCarthy era, Du Bois was explicitly targeted by the state.\n\nIn 1951, Du Bois was indicted by the U.S. government for acting as an agent of a foreign state after he advocated for nuclear disarmament via the Peace Information Center (PIC). Although left-wing figures such as Langston Hughes and Albert Einstein came to his defense, the NAACP declined to support Du Bois during his trial, which ultimately failed to convict him.\n\nDu Bois died on August 27th, 1963, in Accra, the capital of Ghana, at age 95.\n\n\"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.\"\n\n- W.E.B.

        "description": "On this day in 1834, six workers in the English village of Tolpuddle were arrested and sentenced to penal labor in Australia after forming a union. Their case became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the working class, and the men were pardoned.\n\nThe \"Tolpuddle Martyrs\" - George and James Loveless; James Hammett; James Brine; Thomas and John Standfield - had previously formed the \"Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers\" to organize around their shared interest as farm workers. Their arrests took place in the context of a crackdown on protest and worker agitation by the British ruling class, following the Swing Riots of 1830.\n\nThe six men were charged with \"taking an illegal oath\" under the Mutiny Act of 1797, as they had sworn each other to secrecy in order to avoid repression by authorities. The prosecution was driven by their boss, local landowner James Frampton, who also sat on the jury during their trial.\n\nAll six men were sentenced to seven years in Australia in March 1834, sparking outcry from the labor movement. On April 21st, 1834, 30,000 people gathered in modern day King's Cross to present an 800,000-strong petition on the men's behalf. Home Secretary Lord Melbourne avoided workers by hiding behind a set of curtains.\n\nAfter the government attempted to provide conditional pardons in June 1835, the unions continued to push further, compelling the state to give full, unconditional pardons to all six men on March 14th, 1836. The men finally returned home from Australia between 1837 and 1839.\n\nThe case of the Tolpuddle Martyrs became an important milestone and a success for the early English worker movement. Today, this working class victory is commemorated with a museum and annual July festival in the village of Tolpuddle.",

By the next day, 300,000 workers were on strike.\n\nWhile the Nazis were initially caught off-guard, they quickly mobilized to crush the strike before it could develop into a wider revolt. Nazi authorities violently broke up the protests, killing nine people and bringing the general strike to an end after two days.\n\nAccording to author David B. Greene, the February Strike was the first public protest against the Nazis in occupied Europe. The World Jewish Congress identified the rebellion as the only mass protest against the deportation of Jews to be organized by non-Jews.\n\nEven though the uprising failed, the strike is still commemorated in Amsterdam on February 25th every year.",

Stephenson and the clerk began to fight and the veteran threw the clerk through a window. He and his mother were arrested for disturbing the peace.\n\nThat night, a white mob gathered outside of the black-owned part of town, \"Mink Slide\". Rumors were that Stephenson may be lynched, and an armed black crowd began to gather as well. When four policemen tried to enter Mink Slide and refused demands to leave, they were wounded by gunfire.\n\nThe next day, several officers stormed the district, firing randomly into buildings, stealing cash and goods, searching homes without warrants, and taking any guns, rifles, and shotguns they found. When the sweep was over, more than one hundred black people had been arrested, and three hundred weapons had been confiscated.\n\nIn a highly publicized trial, lawyers from the NAACP managed to acquit 23 of 25 black people of attempted murder charges, and the remaining charges were dropped by prosecutors.",

        "description": "On this day in 1986, U.S.-backed Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos fled the country after days of millions protesting in the streets following rigged elections. The uprising is known as the EDSA, People Power, or Yellow Revolution.\n\nFerdinand Marcos had initially assumed power through a popular election in 1965. However, in 1972 he declared martial law during his second term, citing the threat posed by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and other rebel groups, effectively gaining dictatorial powers.\n\nMarcos and his allies embezzled billions of dollars in state assets while the government persecuted and killed dissidents throughout the 1970s and early 80s, enjoying support from the U.S. In 1981, then Vice President George Bush commended Marcos for his \"adherence to democratic principles\".\n\nIn 1983, exiled opposition leader Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino attempted to returned to the country, but was assassinated after landing at Manila International Airport. The shock of this event, alongside an economic crisis, compounded public anger, and civil resistance grew significantly in the following years.\n\nIn response to this pressure, Marcos announced that a snap presidential election would take place in February 1986. Ninoy Aquino's widow Corazon served as the main opposition candidate.\n\nOfficial results from the election saw a victory for Marcos, but the vote saw widespread instances of fraud and intimidation, resulting in a walkout of workers at the national election monitor and a condemnation from the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines.\n\nBoth candidates claimed victory, and Aquino called for civil disobedience and boycott of media and companies which supported Marcos. The \"Reform the Armed Forces Movement\", a group of dissenting military officers, plotted a coup, but were arrested by authorities.\n\nOn February 22nd, the Archbishop of Manila urged civilians via the Catholic radio station Radio Veritas to gather on a stretch of the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, (commonly known as \"EDSA\") in order to help to supply and support rebel officers.\n\nOver the next few days, crowds ballooned, with approximately 2 million participating in total. Marcos ultimately backed down from using lethal force to disperse the crowds, and, faced with growing military defections, fled the country on February 25th, 1986. Corazon Aquino was inaugurated President the same day.\n\nAlthough Marcos' dictatorship was brought to an end and the Philippines has maintained liberal rule as the Fifth Philippine Republic, extrajudicial killings and rampant corruption continued through Aquino's rule and beyond. Less than a year later, 12 people were killed by state forces in the Mendiola Massacre, when police fired on a farmers' march in Manila.\n\nResearcher Mark John Sanchez writes: \"In the years since 1986, the legacy of the People Power Revolution has remained uncertain...The agricultural and economic reform that many Filipinos hoped for in a post-Marcos world did not come. Peace talks with the Communist Party of the Philippines dissolved and leftists continued to be maligned, attacked, and hunted.\"",

        "description": "\"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\" was an anti-Stalin speech delivered by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on this day in 1956.\n\nKhrushchev's speech was sharply critical of the reign of the deceased Joseph Stalin, particularly with respect to the purges which took place in the 1930s. The U.S. State Department received a copy of the speech from East European sources and quickly released it.\n\nThe speech marked a decisive turning point in not just Soviet history, but international communist history more broadly. It led, in part, to the Sino-Soviet Split (deterioration of relations between the USSR and communist China) and was an important milestone in the so-called \"Khrushchev Thaw\", a liberalization of social policies in the USSR.\n\nKhrushchev's denunciation of Stalin caused political turmoil throughout the international communist movement. Historian Lewis Siegelbaum notes that, in Tbilisi, Georgia, students demonstrated against the removal of a monument to Stalin, while in Poland, demonstrations by workers in Poznan over declining wages and deep divisions between recalcitrant Stalinists and anti-Stalinists within the Polish Workers\u2019 Party threatened to engulf the country in crisis. In the West, the Communist Party USA alone lost more than 30,000 members within weeks of its publication.",

        "description": "Nadezhda Krupskaya, born on this day in 1869, was a Bolshevik revolutionary, feminist, and librarian who helped develop the Soviet educational system. In 1926, she authored a memoir of her life and the life of her husband, Vladimir Lenin.\n\nKrupskaya was born to an aristocratic, well-educated family, but grew up with a working class experience. From a young age, Krupskaya was committed to improving the lives of the poor, and was influenced by Leo Tolstoy's ideas and, later, Marxism.\n\nNadezhda met Lenin at an illegal Marxist discussion group (the works of Marx were banned) in February 1894. In October 1896, Krupskaya was arrested and sentenced to three years exile in Ufa. Before she was deported, Nadezhda received a \"secret note\" from Lenin, which suggested that she could take refuge in his village of exile if she became his fianc\u00e9e. This offer was accepted.\n\nKrupskaya was politically active in the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, a precursor to the Bolshevik movement, helping edit the party's newspaper, \"Iskra\" (\"Spark\"). After the 1917 Russian Revolution, she was appointed deputy to the People's Commissar for Education and later served as Deputy Education Commissar (government minister) from 1929 to 1939.\n\nDuring this time, Krupskaya was fundamental in the development of the system of Soviet libraries, establishing formal training for librarians to make them good stewards for working class education and facilitators of the communist revolution.\n\nAccording to American Soviet scholar Robert V. Daniels, in December 1922, after Lenin had suffered a second stroke, Krupskaya had a violent quarrel with Stalin after she denied him access to Lenin, who she claimed was too ill. On December 23rd, she wrote to Lev Kamenev complaining that the \"vile invectives and threats\" from Stalin were the worst abuse she had suffered from a fellow revolutionary in 30 years.\n\nKrupskaya backed anti-Stalin opposition after Lenin's death in 1924. In 1930, she gave a speech defending the leaders of the right wing opposition against Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin and Alexei Rykov. Despite this, Nadezhda retained her post as Deputy Education Commissar until the year of her death in 1939.\n\nIn 1926, Krupskaya wrote a memoir of her life with Lenin, translated in 1930 as \"Memories of Lenin\" and in 1959 as \"Reminiscences of Lenin.\" The text gives the most detailed account of Lenin's life before his coming to power, ending in 1919.\n\n\"Solidarity among the male and female workers, a general cause, general goals, a general path to that goal - that is the solution to the \"woman\" question in the working-class environment.\"\n\n- Nadezhda Krupskaya",

The program was broadcast over the entire continental U.S.\n\nIn 1966, Williams moved to China, where he became a friend and advisor to Mao Zedong. In 1969, he returned to the U.S. and was immediately arrested for fleeing the kidnapping charge, however all charges were dropped.\n\nWilliams' book \"Negroes with Guns\" (1962) details his experience with violent racism and his disagreement with the non-violent wing of the civil rights movement. The text was widely influential; Black Panther Party founder Huey Newton was among those who cited it as an influence.\n\n\"I have asserted the right of Negroes to meet the violence of the Ku Klux Klan by armed self-defense \u2014 and have acted on it. It has always been an accepted right of Americans, as the history of our Western states proves, that where the law is unable, or unwilling, to enforce order, the citizens can, and must act in self-defense against lawless violence.\"\n\n- Robert F.

The case is known as National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corporation.\n\nIn the late 1930s, sit-down strikes had become prevalent in the auto industry and were particularly effective at winning worker demands. In a sit-down strike, workers stay by their station in the factory but refuse to work it. Factory management was usually reluctant to try and force workers out of the factory for fear of damaging expensive machinery, and often capitulated to them.\n\nOn February 17th, 1937, workers frustrated by failed attempts at getting Fansteel to recognize their union announced a sit-down strike and seized a portion of their factory. The employer won an injunction ordering the union men to vacate the premises, which they ignored, but were ultimately forced out.\n\nThe NLRB held on March 14th, 1938, that Fansteel had to reinstate 90 of the workers because the company had violated the law first (precipitating the sit-down strike). Fansteel sued the government in response and won in the Supreme Court case NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp (1939).",

Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was executed for the act, but some historians believe the burning may have been a false flag by the Nazis in order to consolidate their power.\n\nThe first report of the fire came shortly after 9:00 pm on February 27th, 1933. The police conducted a thorough search inside the building and found Van der Lubbe, who was arrested.\n\nOn February 28th, President Paul von Hindenburg issued the \"Reichstag Fire Decree\", suspending civil liberties and beginning a widespread crackdown on communists. The Nazi-controlled police arrested leftists en masse, including all of the communist Reichstag delegates, severely crippling their participation in the elections the following week.\n\nVan Der Lubbe, and four communist leaders were tried in the Leipzig Trial in September 1933. All except Van der Lubbe were acquitted, and the Dutch council communist was executed at the age of 24.\n\nAt the same time Nazis were using the fire as a pretext to suppress their political opponents, communists internationally were accusing Nazis of organizing the fire as a false flag operation. Historians remain divided on the issue, with some concluding that van der Lubbe acting alone and others believing that Nazis were responsible for the arson.\n\nIn July 2019, more than 80 years after the fire, an affidavit from Hans-Martin Lennings, a former member of a Nazi paramilitary, was discovered. The document stated that, the night of the fire, his unit had driven Van der Lubbe from an infirmary to the Reichstag and that the fire was ongoing when they arrived, indicating Van der Lubbe's innocence and possible Nazi complicity.\n\nIn any case, the Reichstag Fire proved a pivotal event in the establishment of Nazi Germany, with Nazis winning the subsequent March elections after imprisoning and terrorizing their left opposition. The Reichstag Fire Decree paved the way for Nazi dictatorship, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.",

Paul Manhart S.J. and ten other residents of the area were apprehended at gunpoint and taken hostage.\n\nThe town was promptly surrounded by an army of U.S. personnel. John Sayer, author of \"Ghost Dancing the Law: The Wounded Knee Trials\", wrote - \"The equipment maintained by the military while in use during the siege included fifteen armored personnel carriers, clothing, rifles, grenade launchers, flares, and 133,000 rounds of ammunition, for a total cost, including the use of maintenance personnel from the National Guard of five states and pilot and planes for aerial photographs, of over half a million dollars.\"\n\nAlthough the Department of Justice (DoJ) prohibited media from the site, the occupation received support from the Congressional Black Caucus and prominent public figures, including Marlon Brando, Johnny Cash, Angela Davis, and Jane Fonda. Angela Davis was turned away by federal forces as an \"undesirable person\" when she attempted to enter Wounded Knee in March 1973.\n\nMarlon Brando asked Sacheen Littlefeather, President of the National Native American Affirmative Image Committee, to speak at the 45th Academy Awards on his behalf. She appeared at the March 27th ceremony in traditional Apache clothing and stated that Brando declined the award due to \"the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry...and on television and movie reruns and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee\".\n\nTribal leaders called off the occupation after 71 days after the killing of Lawrence \"Buddy\" Lamont, a local Oglala man, by U.S. sniper fire. The terms of ending the occupation included a mandated meeting at Chief Fools Crow's land to discuss reinstating the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, which stated that the Black Hills of South Dakota belonged to the Sioux people.\n\nIn the 1980 Supreme Court case United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians, the Court held that the taking of property that was set aside for the use of the nation required just compensation, including interest. The Sioux have not accepted the compensation awarded to them by this case, valued at $1.3 billion as of 2011.\n\n\"If we accept the money, then we have no more of the treaty obligations that the federal government has with us for taking our land, for taking our gold, all our resources out of the Black Hills...we\u2019re poor now, we\u2019ll be poorer then when that happens.\"\n\n- former Oglala Sioux Tribe President Theresa Two Bulls",

        "description": "On this day in 1947, the 228 Massacre took place in Taiwan when anti-government protesters in Taipei were fired on by the army, killing three people. The murders began a period of open rebellion and 38 years of martial law known as the \"White Terror\".\n\nThe incident took place in the wake of drastic political changes following World War II. After the surrender of Japan, the Allies handed administrative control of Taiwan to the Republic of China (ROC, not to be confused with the People's Republic of China, PRC), thus ending 50 years of Japanese colonial rule. The ROC's rule was resented by the local population, characterized by massive price inflation and corruption.\n\nOn February 27th, 1947, state agents confiscated contraband cigarettes from a 40-year-old widow named Lin Jiang-mai (\u6797\u6c5f\u9081). When she demanded their return, one of the men struck her in the head with the butt of his gun, prompting the surrounding Taiwanese crowd to challenge the agents. As they fled, one agent shot his gun into the crowd, killing a bystander.\n\nThe next morning, protesters gathered around Taipei, calling for the arrest and trial of the agents involved in the shooting. Soldiers opened fire into the crowd, killing at least three people.\n\nFormosans (Taiwanese people) took over the administration of the town and military bases on March 4th, and forced their way into local radio station to broadcast news of the incident and calling for people to revolt, causing uprisings to erupt throughout the island.\n\nBy evening, martial law had been declared, and curfews were enforced by the arrest or shooting of anyone who violated curfew. Reinforcements from the Nationalist Government, led by Chen Yi, arrived on March 8th and initiated a brutal campaign of suppression.\n\nOne American eyewitness was cited by the New York Times: \"[ROC troops] indulged in three days of indiscriminate killing and looting...In the poorer sections the streets were said to have been littered with dead. There were instances of beheadings and mutilation of bodies, and women were raped, the American said.\"\n\nThe initial 228 Massacre was followed by 38 years of martial law, commonly referred to as the \"White Terror\", lasting until the end of 1987, during which period over a 100,000 people were imprisoned for political reasons and more than 1,000 were executed. Discussion of the 228 Massacre was prohibited.\n\nSince the end of martial law, the government has set up the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation, a civilian reparations fund supported by public donations for the victims and their families. Today, February 28th is an official public holiday called \"Peace Memorial Day\", on which the president of Taiwan gathers with other officials to ring a commemorative bell in memory of the victims.",

Security forces arrived on the scene and opened fire, resulting in a massacre as they indiscriminately killed demonstrators and bystanders alike.\n\nEstimates of the number of civilians killed range between 200 and 1,500. The casualties were underreported by the New York Times, which reported on March 1st, 1977 that only six people had been killed. President Molina blamed the protests on \"foreign Communists\" and immediately exiled a number of top UNO party members from the country.\n\nOne of the consequences of the massacre was the formation of \"February 28 Popular Leagues\" (Spanish: \"Ligas Populares 28 de Febrero\", LP-28), a movement launched in September 1977 by the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), functioning as its mass front.",

A white supremacist, Berger sought to ban Asian immigrants from the Party.\n\nBorn in Austria-Hungary, Berger immigrated to the United States as a young man and became an influential journalist in Wisconsin, helping establish the \"Sewer Socialist\" movement. In 1910, he was elected as the first socialist to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing a district in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nBerger was a white supremacist, defending segregation on the grounds that \"negroes and mulattoes constitute a lower race - that the Caucasian and even the Mongolian have the start on them in civilization by many years.\"\n\nHistorian Sally Miller notes that Berger also drafted an unsuccessful resolution to ban Asian immigrants from the Socialist Party, stating \"If we admit the Chinese, the Japanese, and the Korean...it will be clear to America's workingmen that the party does not want to help them\".\n\nIn 1919, Berger was convicted of violating the Espionage Act for publicizing his anti-interventionist views surrounding World War I. As a result, he was denied his seat in the House of Representatives. The verdict was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court in 1921, and Berger was elected to three successive terms in the 1920s.",

There were also incidents of police brutality against students protesting Aristide's government.\n\nIn the aftermath, Boniface Alexandre succeeded Aristide as interim president and petitioned the United Nations Security Council for the intervention of an international peacekeeping force. Within days, official U.N. troops the combined forces of U.S., Canadian, French, and Chilean troops arrived on the island. Aristide was forced into exile in South Africa, although he returned to Haiti in 2011.",

Hall in Marshall, Texas was fired for attending a union meeting on company time. In response, District Assembly #101 of the Knights called a strike.\n\nWithin a week, more than 200,000 workers were on strike throughout Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri and Texas, paralyzing railway lines with both inaction and sabotage.\n\nAt least nine people were killed in conflicts between police and crowds of striking workers. On April 9th in East St. Louis, eight deputies guarding a freight train shot into a crowd of strikers, killing six bystanders. The crowd responded by setting the rail yards on fire.\n\nAfter two months of protest, the strike was called off on May 4th without the workers winning their demands. The failure of the strike led directly to the collapse of the Knights of Labor and the rise of the American Federation of Labor (AFL).",

        "description": "On this day in 1921, ~15,000 people assembled in Kronstadt, demanding election reforms, an end to censorship, and the allowance of individual production, marking the beginning of the Kronstadt Rebellion against the nascent Bolshevik government.\n\nThe uprising consisted of sailors, soldiers, and civilians from a variety of political persuasions, including anti-communist reactionaries and anarchists. The uprising was also the last major revolt against the Bolsheviks on Russian territory during the civil war.\n\nThe Kronstadt Rebellion took place in the context of a difficult winter in which fuel and food became scarce. Protests and civil unrest were happening throughout Russia, and sailors in Kronstadt had deposed their commander Raskolnikov in weeks earlier, in late January.\n\nOn February 28th, in reaction to government suppression of protests in Petrograd, the sailors drafted a set of fifteen demands, including free elections, freedom of assembly for peasant and labor organizations, to abolish the Bolshevik fighting detachments in all army branches, and to allow peasants full control of their land, provided they don't employ others.\n\nOn March 2nd, a Provisional Revolutionary Committee was formed, demanding a \"third revolution\" to restore the revolutionary values Kronstadt supporters felt the Bolsheviks had betrayed. The Bolsheviks accused Kronstadt rebels of being counter-revolutionary and petty bourgeois in character, moving to crush the rebellion by force.\n\nOn March 7th, the Red Army began attacking the island with small land forces and aerial bombardment, however little progress was made at first. On March 16th, a Bolshevik force of 50,000 met and defeated the 15,000 rebels, seizing control of the island.\n\n8,000 Kronstadt refugees crossed into Finland within a day of Kronstadt's fall, sabotaging the defenses as they left. Casualty estimates vary widely, but thousands of soldiers were killed on either side.\n\nThe political character of the uprising is seriously contested, and the insurrection has been memorialized by critics of the Soviet Union, from figures such as anarchist Emma Goldman to Boris Yeltsin, the corrupt, anti-communist first President of the Russian Federation. In 1994, Yeltsin rehabilitated the rebels and created a memorial for them in Kronstadt.\n\nAnarchists tend to view the Kronstadt Rebellion as a righteous uprising against an increasingly repressive Soviet state, while Marxist-Leninists generally regard it as counter-revolutionary and petty bourgeois in character.\n\nFor his part, Vladimir Lenin regarded the episode as a critical challenge to the revolution, calling Kronstadt \"undoubtedly more dangerous than Denikin, Yudenich, and Kolchak combined\".\n\nIn 1970, anarchist historian Paul Avrich published a seminal and thorough history of the uprising in English, titled \"Kronstadt, 1921\".",

Colvin was charged with disturbing the peace, violating segregation laws, and battering and assaulting a police officer.\n\nParks was deliberately chosen by the NAACP as a better person to predicate the struggle for civil rights in Montgomery on. Parks was married, employed, and worked as a secretary of the local chapter of the NAACP.\n\nColvin, however, was an unmarried teenager at the time and rumored to be pregnant by a married man. On Colvin's case, Parks stated \"If the white press got ahold of that information, they would have [had] a field day. They'd call her a bad girl, and her case wouldn't have a chance.\" Of Parks, Colvin said \"Her skin texture was the kind that people associate with the middle class. She fit that profile.\"\n\nColvin was one of four women plaintiffs in Browder v. Gayle, the court case that successfully overturned bus segregation laws in Alabama.\n\nColvin left Montgomery for New York City in 1958 because she had difficulty finding work after her participation in the federal court case that overturned bus segregation (similarly, Rosa Parks left Montgomery for Detroit in 1957). Colvin stated she was branded a troublemaker by many in her community. She withdrew from college and went on to become a nurse in Manhattan.\n\nOn her act of defiance that day, Colvin stated \"History kept me stuck to my seat.

It became part of the so-called \"Fish Wars\", a set of protests spanning decades in which Native American tribes around the Puget Sound pressured the U.S. government to recognize fishing rights granted by the Point No Point Treaty.\n\nThe protests eventually won indigenous people in the area the right to fish without state permits - in the 1974 case \"United States v. Washington\", U.S. District Court Judge George Hugo Boldt stated that treaty right fishermen must be allowed to take up to 50% of all potential fishing harvests and required that they have an equal voice in the management of the fishery.\n\nThe so-called \"Boldt Decision\" was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 1979 and has been used as a precedent for handling other, similar treaties.",

It required the enrollment of every male citizen and those immigrants who had filed for citizenship, between 20 and 45 years of age, unless exempted by the Act.\n\nIn protest of the law, a \"Song of the Conscripts\" was written, distributed later at the 1863 New York City Draft Riots. One verse reads:\n\n\"We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more,\n\nWe leave our homes and firesides with bleeding hearts and sore,\n\nSince poverty has been our crime, we bow to thy decree,\n\nWe are the poor who have no wealth to purchase liberty\"",

Busquant fought for Algerian independence alongside her husband, Messali Hadj.\n\n\u00c9milie Busquant was born to a working class, anarchist family in Neuves-Maisons, France. While working in Paris, Busquant met and began dating Messali Hadj, then a young Algerian migrant. Their partnership was marked by a shared commitment to progressive and anti-colonial causes.\n\nDuring Messali's long spells in prison, \u00c9milie often spoke on his behalf and used her position as a French woman to criticize France's commitment to \"civilising\" Algeria. She is sometimes credited with creating the first Algerian flag, however this story is considered apocryphal or exaggerated by some historians.\n\nBusquant died in Algiers in 1953 while her husband was in exile in France. Hadj was refused permission to visit her on her death bed. A cortege of 10,000 followed her coffin, draped in the Algerian flag, through the streets of the Algerian capital on its way to the port.\n\n\u00c9milie's funeral in Neuves-Maisons was attended by delegations from many socialist parties. Under police surveillance, Hadj gave a eulogy recalling her activism, declaring her \"the symbol of the union of the Algerian and French peoples in their shared struggle\".\n\nIn 1962, nine years after \u00c9milie's death, Algeria achieved independence from France. In 2015, journalist Rabah Zanoun produced a film about Busquant's life.",

Together, they organized meetings dealing with the threat of Nazism, meeting in the residences of various members. Up to 100 youths attended these meetings at various times, engaging in political debates and cultural discussions. The group openly distributed leaflets arguing against National Socialism.\n\nOn May 18th, 1942, the Baum Group set fire to the anti-Soviet exhibit \"Das Sowjetparadies\" (The Soviet Paradise), held in the Lustgarten in Berlin. The attempted arson was not successful and the exhibition was re-opened the following day. Nine days later, the Gestapo arrested an unspecified number of Jews and incarcerated them in the internment camp at the Lewetzowstrasse Synagogue.\n\nOn March 6th, 1943, nine captured members were executed: Heinz Rotholz (1922\u20131943), Heinz Birnbaum (1920\u20131943), Hella Hirsch (1921\u20131943), Hanni Meyer (1921\u20131943), Marianne Joachim (1922\u20131943), Lothar Salinger (1920\u20131943), Helmut Neumann (1922\u20131943), Hildegard L\u00f6wy, and Siegbert Rotholz (1922\u20131943).\n\nBoth Herbert and Marianne Baum were executed by the state separately in 1942.",

Their aim was the establishment of an independent Irish Republic by force of arms.\n\nIn 1865, the Fenians began preparing for a rebellion, collecting about 6,000 firearms and as many as 50,000 men willing to fight for Irish independence. The uprising began on February 14th, when Fenians attacked a coastguard station, robbed a man's house and stole his horses, and killed one policeman in County Kerry, however they retreated after discovering Killarney was occupied by the British Army.\n\nThe main rebellion took place on March 5th, when an uprising broke out in Dublin, Cork City, and Limerick. Twelve people were killed, and the attempted revolution failed, in part to poor planning by the Irish and competent surveillance and suppression by the British government.\n\nThe Irish Republicans declared a briefly lived provisional government during the rebellion. Here is an excerpt from their declaration:\n\n\"We have suffered centuries of outrage, enforced poverty, and bitter misery. Our rights and liberties have been trampled on by an alien aristocracy, who treating us as foes, usurped our lands, and drew away from our unfortunate country all material riches.\n\nThe real owners of the soil were removed to make room for cattle, and driven across the ocean to seek the means of living, and the political rights denied to them at home, while our men of thought and action were condemned to loss of life and liberty. But we never lost the memory and hope of a national existence.\"",

After the Ludlow Massacre, he was sentenced to a life of hard labor, later freed on appeal.\n\nThe Ludlow Massacre was a mass murder perpetrated by anti-striker militia during the Colorado Coalfield War. On April 20th, 1914, soldiers from the Colorado National Guard and private guards employed by Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&I) attacked a tent colony of roughly 1,200 striking coal miners and their families in Ludlow, Colorado, killing twenty-one, including children.\n\nDespite this atrocity, Lawson, a leader with the UMWA and not any anti-union militia, was the only person convicted of murder during the strike, for the death of a deputy sheriff who died at Ludlow. Lawson was sentenced to a life of hard labor, but was later freed on an appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court.\n\nLawson also participated in the Cripple Creek Strike of 1903-04. During the strike, Lawson's family home was dynamited in an attack probably executed by mine operators.

While enrolled in an all-girls' gymnasium in Warsaw, Rosa studied banned Polish texts and was a member of the illegal, leftist Proletariat Party.\n\nLuxemburg was very politically active, and an influential member of many political parties. In succession, she served as a member of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL), the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) and, finally, the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), which she co-founded with Liebknecht.\n\nAmong Luxemburg's noted works are \"Social Reform or Revolution?\" (1900), \"The Mass Strike, the Political Party and the Trade Unions\" (1906), and \"The Accumulation of Capital\" (1913).\n\nIn 1918-19, Luxemberg publicly supported a violent rebellion against the German state, organizing through the KPD and the Spartacist League. She was captured and summarily executed by the Freikorps, government-sponsored paramilitary groups consisting mostly of World War I veterans. Her body was thrown in the Landwehr Canal in Berlin.\n\nDue to her pointed criticism of both Leninist and more moderate social democratic schools of socialism, Luxemburg's legacy is a revolutionary school of socialist thought that exists outside of either tradition.\n\n\"Without general elections, without freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, without the free battle of opinions, life in every public institution withers away, becomes a caricature of itself, and bureaucracy rises as the only deciding factor.\"\n\n- Rosa Luxemburg",

In Tianjin, he met his future wife, Deng Yingchao while participating in a radical political group known as the \"Awakening Society\". In 1920, Zhou moved to France, where he helped form the overseas branch of the Chinese Communist Party. He also lived in Britain and Germany before returning to China in 1924.\n\nWhile working in the Political Department of the Whampoa Military Academy, Zhou was also made the secretary of the Communist Party of Guangdong-Guangxi, and served as the CCP representative with the rank of major-general.\n\nAfter the Chinese Civil War broke out in 1927, Zhou served in the communist forces, helping establish and oversee a network of underground cells of communist resistance. Zhou played a leading role in the Long March of 1934-35, an arduous military retreat of communist forces over 8,000 miles.\n\nFollowing the Zunyi Conference in 1935, Mao Zedong became Zhou's assistant. After the conclusion of the Long March, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the CCP, while Zhou took a secondary position as vice-chairman. Both would hold their leadership positions until their deaths in 1976.\n\nZhou was a prominent participant in the 1955 Asian\u2013African Conference, held in Indonesia. The conference produced a declaration in strongly in favor of peace, the abolition of nuclear arms, general arms reduction, and the principle of universal representation at the United Nations. Zhou was critical of American imperial aggression and stated \"the population of Asia will never forget that the first atom bomb was exploded on Asian soil.\"\n\nZhou passed away from bladder cancer on January 8th, 1976, just nine months before Mao Zedong's death in September that year. Frederick C. Teiwes and Warren Sun, two Australian historians, have claimed that Mao was worried that public expressions of mourning would be directed against him and his policies, as Zhou's later years had been closely associated with reversing and moderating its excesses. Out of this concern, Mao thus suppressed public expressions of mourning in the period following his death.\n\n\"Today the first unification of the Chinese people has emerged. The people themselves have become the masters of Chinese soil, and the rule of the reactionaries in China has been irrevocably overthrown.\"\n\n- Zhou Enlai, from \"Chinese People Will not Tolerate Aggression\" (October 1950)",

The Twelve Articles were printed over 25,000 times within the next two months, a tremendous print run for the 16th century. Copies quickly spread throughout Germany.",

She graduated from medical training for paramedics and housewives the day before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. During fighting in her hometown, a wounded Soviet soldier she had been taking care of asked her why the city didn't have a strong partisan movement.\n\nWhen the soldier recovered, Kislyak contacted several partisans hiding out in a nearby forest and asked if she could join their cause, recruiting several acquaintances into the movement. With this organization, she helped kill Nazi officers, sometimes flirting with them to lure them into an isolated area where they could be killed out of sight.\n\nWhen she received word that a Gestapo agent nicknamed \"the Butcher\" would be coming to Kharkiv, she and her partisan unit spent two days planning his capture. Kislyak rented a room right next to his at the farm he was staying at.\n\nAfter courting him for a few days, Mariya lured him to a riverbank, where her conspirators captured him. After interrogating the officer, the group summarily executed him with a crowbar.\n\nIn response, more than one hundred villagers, including Mariya, were collectively arrested by the Gestapo and told they would be killed by a firing squad if the SS man wasn't found alive soon. After the plot became known, Mariya and two others were brutally tortured and interrogated for weeks.\n\nOn June 18th, the group of three was hanged and their bodies put on public display. On May 8th, 1965, she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.",

Opposition to the strike was led by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who wanted to reduce the power of the trade unions.\n\nThe strike was ruled illegal in September 1984, as no national ballot of NUM members had been held, and the labor action failed on March 3rd, 1985. It was a defining moment in British industrial relations, with NUM's defeat significantly weakening the trade union movement and providing a major victory for Thatcher and the Conservative Party.\n\nThe number of strikes fell sharply in 1985, and all of Britain's working pits were closed in the following three decades. Poverty significantly increased in former coal mining areas; in 1994, Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire was the poorest settlement in the country.",

The several hundred protesters were making their first of three attempts to complete the march, which was 54 miles long.\n\nThe march had gone according to plan until protesters reached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they encountered a wall of state troopers and county posse waiting for them on the other side. Earlier that day, County Sheriff Jim Clark had ordered all white men in Dallas County over the age of 21 to report to the courthouse that morning to be deputized.\n\nThe police began assaulting the demonstrators, knocking many to the ground and beating them with nightsticks. Another detachment of troopers fired tear gas, and mounted officers charged the crowd on horseback. One marcher, a 14 year old girl, required 28 stiches in the back of her head.\n\nThis assault ended the first attempt of protesters to march to Montgomery, but it brought international attention to the protest. On March 21st, a third attempt was made to march to Montgomery, this one successful and culminating in 25,000 people arriving at the state capitol building.\n\nThe protest was a watershed moment in the civil rights struggle. By the next year, 11,000 black people successfully registered to vote in Selma, up from just 130.",

One of her last appearances was a speech to striking workers at International Harvester in February 1941, at approximately 90 years old.\n\nParsons was prescient on the nature of labor conflict, stating \"My conception of the strike of the future is not to strike and go out and starve, but to strike and remain in, and take possession of the necessary property of production\", anticipating the labor tactics of sit-down strikes and worker occupations.\n\n\"Never be deceived that the rich will allow you to vote away their wealth.\"\n\n- Lucy Parsons",

        "description": "Rudi Dutschke, born on this day in 1940, was a socialist German sociologist and anti-war activist. In 1967, he advocated for radicals to take a \"long march through the institutions\" as a non-violent way to seek revolutionary change.\n\nRudi Dutschke grew up in post-war East Germany. As a youth, he became involved with the Evangelical Church in East Germany and would later claim religious inspiration for his socialism, tying the idea of spiritual transcendence with societal transcendence.\n\nDutschke's views on socialism, influenced by worker councils during the Hungarian Uprising of 1956, put him in conflict with GDR authorities, and he defected to West Germany shortly before construction of the Berlin Wall began in 1961.\n\nDutschke became influenced by ideas of social provocation proposed by the Situationist International, and joined the Situationist group Subversive Action in 1963. He edited their newspaper and wrote about revolutionary developments in the Third World.\n\nSubversive Action would later join the German Socialist Students' Union, which had formerly been the student wing of the social democratic SPD before being expelled due to being well to the left of its parent organization. After being elected to the political council of the West Berlin SDS in 1965, Dutschke became a major leader calling for student resistance in West Germany, focusing on the Vietnam War in particular.\n\nAs the movement grew, Dutschke's visibility made him a figure of attack from right-wing politicians and press, such as those owned by Axel Springer, which controlled around 67% of West Germany's press market at the time. His family was forced to leave their apartment after it was attacked with smoke bombs, excrement, and threatening graffiti.\n\nIn 1967, Dutschke famously advocated for a \"long march through the institutions\", to join political and media establishments to build power for leftist movements from within.\n\nOn April 11th, 1968, while attempting to collect a prescription for his infant son, Dutschke was shot by Josef Bachmann, a young laborer with ties to neo-Nazi groups. Bachmann shouted \"you dirty, communist pig!\" and shot him three times.\n\nBachman claimed to have been inspired by the assassination of MLK Jr., which had taken place just a week prior. The assassination attempt spawned another wave of attacks on Springer Press facilities by protestors, and the shooting was viewed as a major factor in the rise of the militant Red Army Faction (RAF).\n\nWhile Dutschke survived, he suffered from significant memory and speech issues along with epileptic seizures, and was soon forced to step down from his political roles. He moved with his family to England in 1969, only to be accused by the Conservative Party-controlled UK Home Office of engaging in political activity in 1971 and expelled, before taking up a teaching role at the University of Aarhus in Denmark.\n\nDutschke would later maintain limited political involvement during the 1970s, supporting East German dissidents. His thoughts on the Red Army Faction during this time remain controversial; when RAF member Holger Meins died on hunger strike, he commented at his grave; \"the struggle continues\". However, he grew critical of their actions which risked harm to civilians and people rather than infrastructure and objects.\n\nIn December 1978, Dutschke wrote, \"Every small citizens' initiative, every political and social youth, women, unemployed, pensioner and class struggle movement is a hundred times more valuable and qualitatively different than the most spectacular action of individual terror\".\n\nDutschke died on December 24th, 1979 after suffering an epileptic seizure while taking a bath at his home in Denmark, causing him to drown. Thousands gathered at his funeral, where Protestant theologian Helmut Gollwitzer described him as someone \"fought passionately, but not fanatically, for a more humane world\".",

Members of the raid mailed these documents anonymously to several U.S. newspapers, most of which refused to publish the information. The Washington Post was the first newspaper willing to publish the story.\n\nThe documents detailed widespread illegal surveillance on civil rights activists and contained some of the FBI's most self-incriminating documents, including several that detailed the FBI's use of postal workers and switchboard operators to spy on black civil rights activists.\n\nNoam Chomsky stated that analysis of the stolen documents show that 40% of them were devoted to political surveillance, including two cases involving right-wing groups, ten concerning immigrants, and over two hundred on left or liberal groups. Notably, Muhammed Ali, whose 1971 fight with Joe Frazier provided cover for the burglary, was himself a target of this surveillance.\n\nThe perpetrators were never caught. Over 40 years after the break-in, some participants decided to go public with their story. In 2014, Betty Medsger's book \"The Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret F.B.I.\" was released, which details the burglary and revealed the identities of five of the eight participants. In 2014, filmmaker Johanna Hamilton made a documentary about the event, titled \"1971\".",

The first major protest of the February Revolution occurred on March 3rd when workers at Petrograd's largest industrial plant, the Putilov Factory, announced a strike to demonstrate against the government.\n\nOn March 8th, the strikers were joined by workers celebrating International Women's Day and protesting food rations. These workers recruited more than 50,000 people from other plants. By March 10th, nearly all industry was shut down due to at least 250,000 workers participating in anti-government demonstrations.\n\nOn March 12th, the majority of the city garrison joined the protesters, who seized Petrograd and began hunting police and shooting city officials. Despite a senior government official warning Nicholas II that \"any procrastination [in addressing the protests] is tantamount to death\", Nicholas responded \"again, this fat [official] has written me lots of nonsense, to which I shall not even deign to reply\". He was forced to abdicate the throne three days later.\n\nPower was then shared by the Petrograd Soviet and a Provisional Government (formed by the Provisional Committee of the State Duma, a representational branch of the previous government), declared on March 16th.\n\nThe relationship proved untenable, however (Lenin, for example, insisted on offering no support to the Provisional Government), and ultimately it was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution later that year.",

Their protest was attacked and broken up by police, but the labor action led to the creation of the first women's labor union.\n\nOn the same day in 1908, 15,000 women marched in NYC for shorter work hours, better pay, voting rights, and an end to child labor. The slogan \"Bread and Roses\" emerged from the protest, with bread symbolizing economic security and roses for better living standards.\n\nInternational Women's Day in 1917 was also the date of the Russian February Revolution, in which workers celebrating International Women's Day joined protests and riots against food rationing, with more than 50,000 people in the streets. The protests grew quickly and developed revolutionary fervor, eventually overthrowing the monarchy.\n\nInternational Women's Day (then International Working Women's Day) was introduced during the 1910 International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen, Denmark. Clara Zetkin, a German socialist, suggested a holiday honoring the strike of garment workers in the U.S. The proposal received unanimous approval from the 100 women from 17 countries.",

        "description": "Jeremy Brecher, born on this day in 1938, is an American historian, filmmaker, activist, and author of essential books on labor and social movements, including \"Strike!\" and \"Root & Branch: The Rise of the Workers' Movements\".\n\nIn 1969, Brecher and other collaborators, including Paul Mattick, Jr., Stanley Aronowitz, and Peter Rachleff, began publishing a magazine and pamphlet series called \"Root & Branch\", drawing on the tradition of workers councils and adapting them to contemporary America. In 1975, they published the collection \"Root & Branch: The Rise of the Workers' Movements.\"\n\nIn 1972, Brecher published \"Strike!\", which chronicles the story of \"repeated, massive, and sometimes violent revolts by ordinary working people in America\", in the author's own words. The text, which has been updated as recently as 2020, is published in full at libcom.org.\n\nBrecher's career as a historian was described by fellow historian James R. Green as \"history from below\", pioneering \"shared authority\" between history professionals and the communities they study and write about, with an emphasis on oral history and the historical interpretations formed by the communities in question.",

Frank was arrested more than 50 times in the \"Fish Wars\" of the 1960s and 1970s because of his intense dedication to the treaty fishing rights cause.\n\nThe tribal struggle was taken to the courts in \"U.S. v.

The \"Boldt Decision\" established the 20 treaty Indian tribes in western Washington as co-managers of the salmon resource with the State of Washington, and re-affirmed tribal rights to half of the harvestable salmon returning to western Washington.",

        "description": "Bobby Sands, born on this day in 1954, was an Irish revolutionary who served in the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). Sands died from a hunger strike at age 27 while imprisoned, just one month after becoming the elected MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.\n\nSands grew up in North Belfast, a member of the Catholic minority and in a majority Protestant area. After being threatened at gunpoint and called \"Fenian scum\" by his co-workers at the age of 15, Sands became dedicated to revolutionary politics. In 1972, he attended his first Provisional IRA meeting.\n\nJust a few months later, Sands was arrested and charged in October 1972 with possession of four handguns found in the house where he was living. After being released in 1976, he continued to be active in the IRA.\n\nLater that year, Sands and five others were arrested following the bombing of the Balmoral Furniture Company in Dunmurry and a subsequent shootout with police. Sands and three others were sentenced to 14 years in prison for possession of a revolver.\n\nUndeterred, Sands continued to protest in prison. He refused to wear a prison uniform and was kept in his cell naked without access to bedding for 13 hours a day. While incarcerated, Sands authored poems and songs, published by Republican magazines.\n\nOn March 1st, 1981, Sands initiated a hunger strike in collaboration with other inmates. The demands of the hunger strike included the right to not have to do prison work, the right to not wear a prison uniform, and full restoration of remission lost through protest.\n\nSands narrowly won a special election to serve as MP of Fermanagh and South Tyrone on April 9th, 1981, more than a month into the hunger strike. In response, the British government introduced the \"Representation of the People Act\", which prevents prisoners serving jail terms of more than one year in either the UK or the Republic of Ireland from being nominated as candidates in British elections.\n\nLess than a month after winning this election, Sands died in prison at the age of 27. More than 100,000 people lined the route of Sands' funeral, and he was buried in the New Republican Plot, alongside 76 others.\n\n\"They have nothing in their whole imperial arsenal that can break the spirit of one Irishman who doesn't want to be broken.\"\n\n- Bobby Sands",

With Batista's help, U.S. capital dominated the Cuban economy until he was ousted from power in 1959.\n\nAs part of the coup, Batista canceled national elections three months before they were scheduled to take place. Batista, himself a candidate, was not leading in the polls.\n\nClaiming his actions were necessary to \"save the Republic from chaos\", Batista, with the backing of the army, stormed the Presidential Palace with squads of troops and police surrounding the building. President Pr\u00edo had left the area 30 minutes before however, and the palace was seized without violence.\n\nThe United States recognized his government on March 27th, and Batista allowed U.S. financial interests to dominate Cuba's economy. By the late 1950s, U.S. capitalists owned 90% of Cuban mines, 80% of its public utilities, 50% of its railways, 40% of its sugar production and 25% of its bank deposits, approximately $1 billion in total assets.\n\nWhen asked to analyze Batista's government, historian Arthur Schlesinger wrote \"The corruption of the Government, the brutality of the police, the government's indifference to the needs of the people for education, medical care, housing, for social justice and economic justice...is an open invitation to revolution.\"\n\nAccordingly, Batista's reign ended on January 1st, 1959 when he was ousted from power by communist revolutionaries. Early that morning, Batista fled with an estimated personal fortune of $300 million to the Dominican Republic, where strongman and previous military ally Rafael Trujillo held power. Batista eventually found political asylum in Oliveira Salazar's Portugal and Francisco Franco's Spain, dying in the latter in 1973.",

The majority of the deaths and destruction were caused by an explosion of coal dust, which swept through the mine, however the cause of the explosion was never conclusively proven.\n\nAround 500 miners were able to get to the surface in the hours after the explosion, however survivors trapped underground were found as late as April 4th.\n\nOn the incident, socialist politician Jean Jaur\u00e8s wrote \"It is a call for social justice that comes to the nation's representants from the depths of the burning mines. It is the harsh and suffering destiny of work that, once more, manifests itself to all.

After refusing to follow an anti-strike line from UAW leadership, he was ousted in 1941.\n\nWyndham Mortimer was born March on 11th, 1884 in Karthaus, Pennsylvania, the son of a coal miner who was organized with the Knights of Labor, an early American labor union. He later recalled that one of his earliest memories of life involved \"walking behind parades of striking miners.\"\n\nMortimer left school at age 12 to work in the mines of Pennsylvania as a coal trapper. In 1900, still a teenager, he joined the United Mine Workers of America in 1900. In 1908, Mortimer joined the Socialist Party of America after hearing a campaign speech by the party's Presidential nominee, Eugene V. Debs.\n\nToday, Mortimer is best remembered as a key figure in the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike, during which he was Vice President of the UAW. Also a member of the Communist Party USA, Mortimer was a vehement critic of the efforts of the conservative American Federation of Labor (AFL) to control the union.\n\nIn 1941, Mortimer's refusal to follow the anti-strike line of the UAW's governing Executive Board during a controversial work stoppage at a California aircraft factory led to his termination by the union, effectively bringing an end to his career.\n\n\"The [Walter] Reuther-Murray-Roman Catholic hierarchy has plans for us. They plan to make the American labor movement the staunch ally of monopoly capitalism in its war against the exploited and poverty stricken peoples of the world. And here at home, their witch hunting, disrupting, and raiding of other unions, is treason to the American working class.\"\n\n- Wyndham Mortimer, in his autobiography \"Organize!

A lengthy investigation led the Nazis back to Gertner and Roza, and then to Estusia Wajcblum and Regina Safirsztajn, who were also implicated in the conspiracy. They were interrogated and tortured for weeks.\n\nGertner, along with three co-conspirators, were executed on January 5th or 6th (sources differ) in 1945.

Vassev was persecuted for this work, serving time in prison and having to assume a fake identity (he was born Jordan Sotirov and adopted the name Manol Vassev to escape authorities). He was also active in anti-fascist resistance during World War II.\n\nVassev was arrested by the communist police for the first time on March 10th, 1945, along with all the delegates to the national conference of the Anarchist Communist Federation at Kniajevo, near Sofia. He was interned at the concentration camp of Dupnitsa and then at Kutzian.\n\nAfter serving five years in prison, a trial was held for a second sentence. Held in public, Vassev was accused of being an \"agent in the pay of the Anglo-Americans\".\n\nVassev interrupted the accusation, retorting \"It isn't me who signed the Teheran and Yalta treaties with the English and the Americans; it's not me who went to London to kiss the skirt of the Queen of England!\"\n\nVassev died the day before his release was scheduled, poisoned by the Bulgarian secret police.",

        "description": "On this day in 1957, the Directorio Revoluncionari Estudiantil, a group of anti-Batista, revolutionary Cuban students, attacked the Presidential Palace in Havana in a failed attempt to assassinate Fulgencio Batista and overthrow the government.\n\nParticipants of the attack successfully stormed the palace, making it to the third floor and killing many of Batista's personal guards, but failed to locate and kill Batista himself. The rebellion was successfully quelled, and two of the revolutionaries were put on trial; the rest were either killed or escaped.\n\nA large pro-Batista rally, attended by ~250,000 people, took place on April 7th. Signs read \"For Batista, in the Past, Now and Forever\" and \"Five Hundred American Residents of the Isle of Pines Have Faith in Batista.\"\n\nOn January 22nd, 1959, Fidel Castro stated to journalists that individual-focused acts such as the palace attack are \"false concepts about the revolution\" because \"tyranny is not a man; tyranny is a system...We were never supporters of tyrannicide or military coups, [which tended] to inculcate the people a complex of impotence.\"",

        "description": "On this day in 1979, the People's Revolutionary Government (PRG) was proclaimed in Grenada after the Marxist-Leninist New Jewel Movement overthrew the state in a socialist revolution, with Maurice Bishop serving as Prime Minister.\n\nAfter coming into power, Bishop stated the goals of the NJM: \"We definitely have a stake in seeking the creation of a new international economic order which would assist in ensuring economic justice for the oppressed and exploited peoples of the world, and in ensuring that the resources of the sea are used for the benefit of all the people of the world and not for a tiny minority of profiteers\".\n\nThe new government developed an ambitious social program, initiating a literacy campaign, expanding education programs, worker protections, and establishing farmers' cooperatives.\n\nDuring the PRG's reign, unemployment was reduced from 49% to 14%, the ratio of doctors per person increased from 1/4000 to 1/3,000, the infant mortality rate was reduced, and the literacy rate increased from 85% to 90%. In addition, laws guaranteeing equal pay for equal work for women were passed, and mothers were guaranteed three months' maternity leave.\n\nThe government suspended the constitution of the previous regime, ruling by decree until a factional conflict broke out, ultimately leading to Maurice Bishop's assassination. President Ronald Reagan launched an invasion of Grenada a few weeks later, on October 25th, 1983.\n\n\"We have attempted to show in this Manifesto what is possible. We have demonstrated beyond doubt that there is no reason why we should continue to live in such poverty, misery, suffering, dependence and exploitation...The new society must not only speak of Democracy, but must practise it in all its aspects. We must stress the policy of 'Self-Reliance' and 'Self-Sufficiency' undertaken co-operatively, and reject the easy approaches offered by aid and foreign assistance. We will have to recognise that our most important resource is our people.\"\n\n- Manifesto of the New Jewel Movement (1973)",

        "description": "On this day in 2018, Marielle Franco, a queer feminist and socialist politician in Brazil, was assassinated by police. The day before her death, she tweeted \"How many others will have to die for this war [with police] to end?\"\n\nMarielle Franco (1979 - 2018) was raised in Mar\u00e9, a slum in northern Rio de Janeiro, where she also resided for most of her life. Franco began working to support her family at eleven years old and raised her daughter while working as a preschool teacher for minimum wage.\n\nAs an adult, Franco earned a master's degree in public administration from the Fluminense Federal University. Her master's thesis was titled \"UPP: The Reduction of the Favela to Three Letters\", dealt with a law enforcement program to retake control of Rio's favelas from gangs.\n\nIn 2016, Franco ran for Rio de Janeiro City Council and won her seat with more than 46,500 votes. As a city council member, Franco fought against violence against women, for reproductive and gay rights, and for the rights of favela residents.\n\nOn March 14th, 2018, Franco attended a round-table discussion titled \"Young Black Women Moving [Power] Structures\" (Portuguese: Jovens Negras Movendo Estruturas). Two hours after leaving the talk, Franco and her driver were assassinated by two men driving another car. Franco had been planning to marry her partner M\u00f4nica Ben\u00edcio that September.\n\nTwo former members of the military police were arrested for the murders in March 2019. All presidential candidates in Brazil during the 2018 campaign condemned the crime, except for Jair Bolsonaro, who repeatedly refused to condemn the assassination.\n\n\"Though we may earn lower salaries, be relegated to lower positions, work triple workdays, be judged for our clothing, be subjected to sexual, physical, psychological violence, killed daily by our partners, we will not be silenced: our lives matter!\"\n\n- Marielle Franco, from a speech she was preparing to give days after her assassination",

It is the only mutiny of a United States ship in recent history.\n\nThe ship was under contract with the Military Sea Transportation Service to carry napalm bombs to be used by the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War and was originally bound for Sattahip, Thailand.\n\nDuring the uprising, 24 of the crew were forced into two lifeboats and set adrift in the Gulf of Thailand while the remainder of the crew were forced to take the ship to a bay near Sihanoukville, Cambodia. The two mutineers had planned to take political refuge in Cambodia, however Prince Sihanouk had just been deposed by a coup the led by the pro-U.S. Sirik Matak and Lon Nol. Instead, they became prisoners of the new Cambodian government.\n\nOne mutineer, Alvin Glatkowski, turned himself in at an American Embassy, was extradited to the U.S., and served seven years in prison. The other mutineer, Clyde McKay, escaped capture and sought out the Khmer Rouge. Remains from Cambodia were positively identified as McKay's in 2005.",

        "description": "On this day in 1836, six English workers who had been sentenced to penal labor in Australia after forming a trade union were pardoned, following years of mass working class protests on their behalf.\n\nThe \"Tolpuddle Martyrs\" - George and James Loveless; James Hammett; James Brine; Thomas and John Standfield - had previously formed the \"Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers\" to organize around their shared interest as farm workers. Their arrests took place during a crackdown on protest and worker agitation by the British ruling class following the Swing Riots of 1830.\n\nThe six men were charged with \"taking an illegal oath\" under the Mutiny Act of 1797, as they had sworn each other to secrecy in order to avoid repression by authorities. The prosecution was driven by their boss, local landowner James Frampton, who also sat on the jury during their trial.\n\nAll six men were sentenced to seven years' transportation to Australia in March 1834, sparking outcry from the organized labor movement. On April 21st, 1834, 30,000 people gathered in modern day King's Cross to present an 800,000-strong petition on the men's behalf. Home Secretary Lord Melbourne avoided the workers by hiding behind a set of curtains.\n\nAfter the government attempted to provide conditional pardons in June 1835, the unions continued to push further, compelling the state to give full, unconditional pardons to all six men on March 14th, 1836. The men finally returned home from Australia between 1837 and 1839.\n\nThe case of the Tolpuddle Martyrs became an important milestone and a success for the early English worker movement. Today, this working class victory is commemorated with a museum and annual July festival in the village of Tolpuddle.",

        "description": "Nikolai Bukharin was a prominent Bolshevik revolutionary and Marxist theorist who was executed by the Soviet Union on this day in 1938, following a controversial trial and international pleas for clemency.\n\nAs a young man, Bukharin joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906, becoming a member of the Bolshevik faction. He served on a committee that was infiltrated by the Tsarist secret police, the Okhrana, and was imprisoned and exiled in 1911.\n\nIn 1911, Bukharin escaped exile, fleeing to Germany. During this period, he met Vladimir Lenin for the first time and authored \"Imperialism and World Economy\", a work that predated and influenced Lenin's \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\".\n\nAfter Lenin's death in 1924, Bukharin became a full member of the Politburo, allying himself with Stalin in the power struggles of that period. Bukharin formulated the thesis of \"Socialism in One Country\" put forth by Stalin in 1924, which argued that socialism could be developed in a single country, even one as underdeveloped as Russia.\n\nBukharin was aligned with the forces that defeated Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, and Grigory Zinoviev in various power struggles within the Communist Party. A supporter of the market-based New Economic Policy (NEP), Bukharin opposed Stalin's support of collectivization policies in the late 1920s. On this basis, he was criticized and began politically conspiring against Stalin.\n\nAfter the trial and execution of Zinoviev, Kamenev, and other leftist Old Bolsheviks in 1936, Bukharin was arrested in 1937 and charged with conspiring to overthrow the Soviet state. The following trial was controversial and drew international criticism, alienating some communist sympathizers abroad.\n\nFrench author Romain Rolland wrote to Stalin directly, arguing that \"an intellect like that of Bukharin is a treasure for his country\", drawing comparisons to the execution of chemist Antoine Lavoisier, guillotined during the French Revolution: \"We in France, the most ardent revolutionaries...still profoundly grieve and regret what we did...I beg you to show clemency.\" Bukharin was executed by gunshot on March 15th, 1938, at the Kommunarka shooting ground.\n\n\"We see now that infringement of freedom is necessary with regard to the opponents of the revolution. At a time of revolution we cannot allow freedom for the enemies of the people and of the revolution. That is a surely clear, irrefutable conclusion.\"\n\n- Nikolai Bukharin",

The incident sparked global outrage and spurred the domestic anti-war movement.\n\nThree U.S. servicemen who had tried to halt the massacre and rescue civilians were shunned and denounced as traitors, including by multiple members of Congress.\n\n\"It is why I\u2019m old before my time. I remember it all the time. I\u2019m all alone and life is hard. Thinking about it has made me old...I won\u2019t forgive as long as I live - think of the babies being killed, then ask me why I hate them.\"\n\n- A Vietnamese survivor of the My Lai massacre",

Philip Randolph on the March on Washington Movement in 1941 to press for an end to racial discrimination in employment. Rustin later organized Freedom Rides and helped to organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to strengthen Martin Luther King Jr.'s leadership, teaching King about nonviolence and later serving as an organizer for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nDespite his overtly left-wing political positions, such as supporting universal healthcare and full employment, later in his career Rustin became known for more moderate political takes. In 1966, Rustin stated the slogan \"black power\" \"lacked any real value for the civil rights movement\". Rustin also gave repeated and full-throated support for Israel.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin served on many humanitarian missions, such as aiding refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia. At the time of his death in 1987, he was on a humanitarian mission in Haiti.\n\n\"When an individual is protesting society's refusal to acknowledge his dignity as a human being, his very act of protest confers dignity on him.\"\n\n- Bayard Rustin",

Makhno and thirteen others were sentenced to death by hanging, however Makhno's sentence was commuted to life in prison due to his prior military service.\n\nAfter returning to Ukraine, he became a key figure in the organization of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine (also known as the Black Army), which helped organize and protect an anarcho-communist movement in Ukraine known as the Free Territory or Makhnovschina. This movement was established in the context of the Russian Civil War a complex power struggle following the Bolshevik-led October Revolution of 1917.\n\nThe anarchist revolution was defeated by the Bolsheviks in 1921, who would go on to win the civil war and establish the Soviet Union. Makhno fled, living the rest of his life exiled in Western Europe. After settling in Paris, Makhno contributed writings to anarchist journals and met anarchists of note, including Buenaventura Durruti and Francisco Ascaso.\n\n\"I would still call on you, reader and brother, to take up the struggle for the ideal anarchism, for only if you fight for this ideal and uphold it will you understand it properly.\"\n\n- Nestor Makhno",

The murders caused international outrage, and the colonel who ordered the attack fled to the U.S.\n\nThe four journalists had arrived in El Salvador on February 24th, 1982 to report on the ongoing Salvadoran Civil War, fought between the right-wing military junta ruling the country with U.S. support, and the left-wing Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN).\n\nAs part of their work, the journalists visited Mariona prison in San Salvador to interview and film prisoners accused of belonging to the guerrilla forces. The videos filmed by the journalists included shots of prisoners' scars, which the prisoners said were the result of torture.\n\nThis work earned the ire of the military, and the journalists were interrogated by the Director-General of the Treasury Police on March 11th. Despite being advised to leave by Jan Pierre Lucien Schmeitz, another Dutch journalist, as well as their FMLN contacts, the group decided to stay to complete their work.\n\nOn March 17th, 1982, soldiers from the Atonal Battalion, acting on orders from Colonel Reyes Mena, assassinated the journalists while they were traveling with a group of five FMLN soldiers. All but one of the FMLN guerillas survived.\n\nThe deaths caused international outrage, including mass protests in the Netherlands. The Dutch government conducted an investigation which uncovered the fact that U.S. soldiers were present at the base the day of the massacre.\n\nThe 1993 Report of the UN Truth Commission on El Salvador concluded that the murders were a targeted assassination by the state (not an \"accident\", as the Salvadoran President claimed), and were in violation of international law. The report was aided by the testimony of \"Martin\", the lone survivor of the attack.\n\nSalvadoran Col. Reyes Mena, whom the U.N. concluded ordered the massacre, fled to the United States after the incident.

        "description": "On this day in 1871, French soldiers refused orders from their superiors to disarm working class neighborhoods in Paris, arresting them and joining working class radicals in the revolution that would become the Paris Commune.\n\nOn the morning of March 18th, French soldiers members began attempting to remove cannons from working class neighborhoods in Paris, left there following the end of the Franco-Prussian War. As soldiers became surrounded by members of the National Guard, a popular Parisian militia with radical tendencies, the soldiers' superior officer, General Lecomte, ordered them to fire on the crowd.\n\nThis order was refused. Many soldiers mutinied, joining the National Guard. Some of the military officers were disarmed and escorted away, while others, including General Lecomte, were arrested. Lecomte himself was executed later that day. This incident marked the beginning of a working class revolution in Paris, one anticipated by the conservative national government of Adolphe Theirs.\n\nOn March 26th, elections were held to establish a Paris Commune council, consisting of 92 members, one for every 20,000 residents. Out of 485,000 registered voters, more than 230,000 voted. Participation was significantly higher in working class neighborhoods than bourgeois ones.\n\nOn March 27th, the Commune was formally declared. Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray, a participant of the Commune and author of \"History of the Paris Commune of 1871\", describes the celebration:\n\n\"The next day 200,000 'wretches' came to the H\u00f4tel-de-Ville there to install their chosen representatives, the battalion drums beating, the banners surmounted by the Phrygian cap and with red fringe round the muskets; their ranks, swelled by soldiers of the line, artillerymen, and marines faithful to Paris, came down from all the streets to the Place de Greve like the thousand streams of a great river...\n\nA member of the Committee announced the names of those elected. The drums beat a salute, the bands and two hundred thousand voices chimed in with the Marseillaise. [Gabriel] Ranvier, in an interval of silence, cried out, 'In the name of the People the Commune is proclaimed.'\n\nA thousandfold echo answered, 'Vive la Commune!' Caps were flung up on the ends of bayonets, flags fluttered in the air. From the windows, on the roofs, thousands of hands waved handkerchiefs...The quick reports of the cannon, the bands, the drums, blended in one formidable vibration. All hearts leaped with joy, all eyes filled with tears.\"\n\nThe government of the Paris Commune developed a set of policies that tended towards a progressive, secular, and highly democratic social democracy, although its existence was too brief to implement them with much permanence. Among these policies were the separation of church and state, abolition of child labor, abolishment of interest on some forms of debt, as well as the right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if it was deserted by its original owner.\n\nThe national French Army suppressed the Commune at the end of May during La semaine sanglante (\"The Bloody Week\"), beginning on May 21st, 1871. Even after the Commune was defeated, the Army continued their campaign of slaughter.\n\nIn an 1886 account of the Paris Commune, The Socialist League wrote \"Thus was extinguished the despair of Paris; but though the fighting was over, the killing went on merrily; for instance, in the prison of La Roquette alone nine hundred prisoners were slain in cold blood, and without any pretence of form of trial. The courts martial disposed of others. 'Have you taken arms, or served the Commune? Show your hands.' If the judge thought the man looked likely, 'class\u00e9' was the word; if anyone was spared, \u201cordinaire\u201d was pronounced, and he was kept for Versailles. None were released \u2014 sex or age made no difference. Those who were 'class\u00e9s' were shot at once; perhaps they were not the unluckiest.\"\n \nA watershed moment in revolutionary working class history, the Paris Commune was analyzed by many communist thinkers, including Karl Marx, who identified it as a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" Vladimir Lenin danced in the snow in celebration when the newly formed Bolshevik government lasted longer than the Paris Commune.\n\n\"It is time people understood the true meaning of this Revolution; and this can be summed up in a few words\u2026It was the first attempt of the proletariat to govern itself. The workers of Paris expressed this when in their first manifesto they declared they 'understood it was their imperious duty and their absolute right to render themselves masters of their own destinies by seizing upon the governmental power.'\"\n\n- Eleanor Marx",

Blackwell also served as a project director for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and helped organize voter drives for African Americans across Mississippi.\n\nBlackwell was responsible for one of the first desegregation cases in Mississippi, filing a suit, Blackwell v. Issaquena County Board of Education, against the Issaquena County Board of Education after the principal suspended more than 300 black children - including her son - for wearing pins that depicted a black hand and a white hand clasped with the word \"SNCC\" below them.\n\nAlthough the courts ruled that the students could not wear the pins, they also ruled that the school district in question must desegregate. Blackwell's son and approximately 50 other children boycotted the school because of its decision to not let the children wear the SNCC freedom pins.\n\nAs a result, Blackwell and some other activists in the community formed \"Freedom Schools\" in Issaquena County to resolve the issue. The Freedom Schools were popular and remained open until the school system finally integrated in 1970.\n\n\"Movements are not radical. Movements are the American way. A small group of abolitionists writing and speaking eventually led to the end of slavery. A few stirred-up women brought about women's voting. The Populist movement, the Progressive movement, the anti-Vietnam War movement, the women's movement - the examples go on and on of 'little people' getting together and telling the truth about their lives.

        "description": "On this day in 1969, the \"Chicago Eight\", protesters associated with the 1968 DNC riots, including Black Panther co-founder Bobby Seale and civil rights activist Abbie Hoffman, were indicted for conspiracy, crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot, and various other crimes associated with the counter-cultural protests in Chicago.\n\nAt the 1968 Democratic National Convention, activists from around the United States came to Chicago to protest the Vietnam War and other U.S. policies.\n\nThe protests were attended by a variety of organizations, including the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, the Youth International Party (\"Yippies\"), and the Poor People's Campaign, led by Ralph Abernathy. The protests devolved into a melee with a militarized police presence, later described by a federal commission as a \"police riot\", outside the Conrad Hilton Hotel, an incident that was broadcast internationally.\n\nFollowing federal investigations into the incident, Chief Judge William J. Campbell of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois convened a grand jury to investigate whether the organizers of the demonstrations had violated federal law and whether any police officers had interfered with the civil rights of the protesters.\n\nOn March 20th, 1969, this grand jury indicted eight organizers associated with the protests: Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin of the Youth International Party; pacifist organizer David Dellinger; Tom Hayden, Lee Weiner, and Rennie Davis of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam; chemist John Froines; Bobby Seale, co-founder of the Black Panther Party.\n\nDespite being charged with conspiracy, these individuals were only tenuously linked through their participation in the 1968 protests. Author Bruce Ragsdale noted in 2008: \"The eight were linked less by common action or common political goals than by a shared radical critique of U.S. government and society.\"\n\nThe trial itself was fraught with outbursts from the defendants and celebrity testimony: Seale called the presiding judge a \"rotten racist pig, fascist liar\" and later appeared before the jury bound, gagged, and chained to his chair; Hoffman attempted to bring in a Vietnamese flag to the courtroom and fought for possession of it with a court marshal; witnesses included Phil Ochs, Arlo Guthrie, Allen Ginsberg, and Timothy Leary.\n\nSeale's case was declared a mistrial, while the remaining seven were convicted of a total of 159 counts of criminal contempt. On February 18th, 1970, the jury acquitted all seven defendants of conspiracy, and Froines and Weiner of all charges. At his sentencing, Dellinger stated:\n\n\"Whatever happens to us, however unjustified, will be slight compared to what has happened already to the Vietnamese people, to the black people in this country, to the criminals with whom we are now spending our days in the Cook County jail. I must have already lived longer than the normal life expectancy of a black person born when I was born, or born now. I must have already lived longer, 20 years longer, than the normal life expectancy in the underdeveloped countries which this country is trying to profiteer from and keep under its domain and control.\"",

        "description": "Ota Benga was a Mbuti man brought from his African homeland as a teen and displayed like an animal at the Bronx Zoo. After World War I interfered with his plans to return to Central Africa, Benga shot himself on this day in 1916.\n\nWhen Ota was a teenager, his entire village, including his wife and two children, was slaughtered by the Force Publique, a private army created by Belgian King Leopold to enforce rubber production quotas. Benga was then kidnapped by slave traders and put to work in an agricultural village.\n\nIn 1904, Benga was freed by an American businessman Samuel Verner, who was under contract from the St. Louis World Fair to bring back African pygmies to be part of a human exhibition. Verner found Benga and negotiated his release from the slave traders for a pound of salt and a bolt of cloth. Verner recruited other Africans for the exhibit as well, and the group, including Benga, was brought to St. Louis in June 1904.\n\nTwo years later, Benga was hired by the Bronx Zoo to help take care of animals. After noticing that some visitors paid more attention to Benga than the animals, zoo officials \"exhibited\" him in the organization's Monkey House.\n\nA group of black New York clergymen, led by Rev. James H. Gordon, demanded that he be freed. By the end of 1906, 23-year-old Benga was released to the custody of Rev. Gordon, who placed him in the New York City\u2019s Howard Colored Orphan Asylum.\n\nBenga began working at a local tobacco factory in Lynchburg, Virginia to pay for his journey back to Central Africa. After the outbreak of World War I, however, passenger ship travel became severely limited and he was unable to make the journey.\n\nOn March 20th, 1916, Ota Benga built a ceremonial fire and shot himself in the heart with a borrowed pistol. He was approximately 33 years old.",

        "description": "On this day in 2003, Iraq was invaded by the U.S. and a \"coalition of the willing\", including the U.K., Australia, and others. The invasion and subsequent military occupation killed more than one million people and displaced 9.2 million Iraqis.\n\nThe invasion came after the U.S. government lied about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein possessing \"weapons of mass destruction\", including a now-infamous appearance at the United Nations by then Secretary of State Colin Powell, in which he falsely stated \"Indeed, the facts and Iraq's behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction\".\n\nOn March 20th, a coalition of forces led by the United States invaded Iraq. The day afterward, 76% of Americans approved of military action against Iraq, according to a March 2003 Gallup poll.\n\nThe invasion and subsequent military occupation caused widespread death, disease, and displacement for the people of Iraq. According to Brown University's Costs of War project, since 2003, more than 9.2 million Iraqis have been displaced, and more than 300,000 people have been killed as a direct result of violence. In 2007, Opinion Research Business (ORB) estimated that more than one million people have died as a result of the war.\n\nKurdish feminist Houzan Mahmoud opposed the invasion, speaking at a London anti-war rally in 2003. In a 2017 interview, she stated:\n\n\"I asserted my opposition to the war on Iraq, despite the fact of being Kurdish and someone who has suffered immensely under Saddam's regime. I still didn't think that any foreign intervention was going to improve our lives. I also emphasised that this war will only bring more terrorism because it will strengthen political Islam, i.e. Islamism...\n\nThere is no doubt that we all wanted an end to Saddam's totalitarian regime, but I was opposed to foreign invasion. In this region we don't have a good experience with foreign interventions and colonialism throughout history. Imperialist powers invade, destroy and support or install puppet regimes to serve their interest only. Look at Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 since the invasion we are faced with much more terrorism, instability, poverty, displacement and mass migration of people. There is a humanitarian disaster and an endless tragedy of war and bloodshed.\"",

While studying there, Jingyu read many of Marx's works and became a communist. In 1923, Xiang Jingyu was elected as a Central Committee member and became the first secretary of the \"Women's Movement Committee\".\n\nIn 1924, she led a strike involving about 10,000 female workers from silk factories and later founded the \"Committee of Women's Liberation\", which trained many female cadres to oppose feudalism and imperialism.\n\nOn March 20th, 1928, Xiang Jingyu was arrested in the French Concession Sandeli in Wuhan, possibly due to the betrayal of members of her group to the police. The French officials turned her over to Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government in April. On May 1st, 1928, Xiang Jingyu was executed by Guomindang police. After her death, she became a martyr for the communist revolution in China.",

        "description": "Anton Lembede, born on this day in 1914, was a South African lawyer, activist, and founding president of the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) who played a key role in the ideological development of African nationalism.\n\nLembede was born to a peasant family in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. He showed great academic potential as student, studying at the prestigious Adams College despite his family's poverty. Lembede later earned a law degree from the University of South Africa in 1942.\n\nLembede was the principal thinker behind launching the African National Congress Youth League. In 1943, he led Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, and other to-be prominent figures in the anti-apartheid struggle in forming the organization, becoming the first elected general president of the ANC Youth League in 1944. The league wanted to reform the ANC, which they described as \"a body of gentlemen with clean hands\".\n\nIn 1945 Lembede, Water Sisulu, and Oliver Tambo almost succeeded in persuading the Transvaal Congress to expel the communists from its membership for opposing African nationalism.\n\nIn 1947, at the age of 33, Lembede died suddenly from an unknown intenstinal illness. Despite his short lifespan, Lembede influenced prominent South African thinkers such as Nelson Mandela, who wrote \"From the moment I heard Lembede speak, I knew I was seeing a magnetic personality who thought in original and often startling ways.\"\n\nMandela also credited Lembede's ideas as influencing his own - \"Lembede's views struck a chord in me...I came to see the antidote as militant African nationalism.\"\n\nLembede is regarded as the architect of the \"Programme of Action\" that was adopted as a guiding document by the 1949 meeting of the African National Congress.\n\n\"We have to go out as apostles to preach the New Gospel of Africanism and to hasten and bring about the birth of a new nation. Such minor insignificant differences of languages, customs etc. will not hinder or stop the irresistible onward surge of the African spirit.\"\n\n- Anton Lembede",

Finucane was assassinated in 1989 by loyalist forces acting in collusion with the British state. No member of state security forces has been prosecuted for his murder.\n\nPatrick Finucane was born on March 21st, 1949 to a prominent Republican family in Belfast. Three of his brothers were Irish Republican Army (IRA) members, two of whom would be imprisoned by the British government.\n\nFinucane himself was a criminal defense lawyer. Although he had represented both Republicans and loyalists, Finucane's most notable client was likely Bobby Sands, a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) who died on hunger strike while imprisoned at HM Prison Maze in Northern Ireland.\n\nOn February 12th, 1989, while eating a Sunday meal at home with his wife and three children, Finucane was shot fourteen times by two gunmen. Twelve shots were to his face. The loyalist paramilitary Ulster Defence Association took credit for his murder, alleging without evidence that Finucane was a high-ranking member of the IRA.\n\nFollowing a 2001 peace agreement, the British government promised to consider opening an inquiry into Finucane's death, appointing an international judge to review his case. The government declined to open an inquiry, however, after the judge found evidence of state collusion.\n\nIn 2004, Ken Barrett, a member of the Ulster Defence Association, pled guilty to Finucane's murder. The identity of the second gunman remains unknown.\n\nIn 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron met with Pat Finucane's family and admitted to state collusion in his assassination, but as of February 2022 no member of the British security services has been prosecuted.\n\nOn November 30th, 2020, Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland Secretary, rejected calls for a public inquiry into Finucane's killing.",

By highlighting racial injustice, they contributed to the passage of the Voting Rights Act that year, a landmark federal achievement of the civil rights movement.\n\nThe first attempt to make the march happened on March 7th, but failed due to police brutality. Police knocked marchers to the ground, beat them with nightsticks, and fired teargas. One marcher, a 14 year old girl, required 28 stitches in the back of her head. Although the assault ended the first attempt of protesters to march to Montgomery, it brought international attention to the protest.\n\nAfter a federal court ruled that the march was legal, the third and successful attempt to march to Montgomery was made. By its end, 25,000 people marched to steps of the State Capitol Building in Montgomery. The protest was a watershed moment in the civil rights struggle, and, by the next year, 11,000 black people were successfully registered to vote in Selma.",

More than 20,000 protesters showed up at the police station in opposition to apartheid.\n\nThe unarmed crowd was met with armored police armed with Sten submachine guns and Lee\u2013Enfield rifles. After F-86 Sabre jets and Harvard Trainers flew low over the crowd, within a hundred feet of the ground, in an attempt to scatter it, the crowd began throwing rocks at police.\n\nThe police responded by opening fire on the crowd, killing 69 people and injuring 180 others. 29 children were casualties of the violence, and many people were shot in the back as they fled.\n\nA storm of international protest followed the Sharpeville shootings, including sympathetic demonstrations in many countries and condemnation from the United Nations. Sharpeville marked a turning point in South Africa's history; the country found itself increasingly isolated in the international community.\n\nThe Sharpeville Massacre contributed to the banning of the PAC and ANC as illegal organizations. The massacre was one of the catalysts for a shift from passive resistance to armed resistance by both of these groups.",

        "description": "On this day in 1947, U.S. President Harry Truman signed the \"Loyalty Order\", an executive order designed to root out communist influence in the federal government, allowing the FBI to screen federal employees for left-wing sympathies.\n\nThe order led to the creation of the first general loyalty program in the United States, which investigated more than three million government employees. Approximately 300 were determined to be security risks and fired.\n\nThe Loyal Order established a wide domain for the departmental loyalty boards to conduct screenings of federal employees and job applicants, allowing the FBI to run initial name checks on federal employees and authorize further field investigations if the initial inquiry uncovered information that cast someone in a negative light.\n\nExecutive Order 9835 also was the main impetus for the creation of the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO). It was later revoked by Eisenhower in 1953, but only to further expand the restrictions in a new executive order (Executive Order 10450). Both executive orders were later repealed by President Bill Clinton (Executive Orders 12968 and 13087).",

His military career against the Spanish began in August 1896 with the Katipunan-led Philippine Revolution.\n\nAguinaldo would go on to lead Philippine forces against multiple colonizing forces - first against Spain in the Philippine Revolution (1896 - 1898), again in the Spanish-American War (1898), and finally against the United States during the Philippine-American War (1899-1901).\n\nAguinaldo was involved in multiple controversies as a government leader, most notably his role in the execution of Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio (1863 - 1897), the leader of the Katipunan group. Bonifacio was a prominent revolutionary and political dissident to Aguinaldo's authority. The trial in which he was convicted is now seen as dubious.\n\nAlthough Aguinaldo was the first president of an Asian constitutional republic, this government was dissolved by invading U.S. forces, and he was forced to swear an oath of allegiance to the U.S. Aguinaldo was 77 when the United States finally recognized Philippine independence in the Treaty of Manila on July 4th, 1946, in accordance with the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act of 1934.",

        "description": "On this day in 1931, Marxist Indian revolutionary Bhagat Singh was executed by the colonial British government at 29 years of age after assassinating a police officer and exploding two bombs in a government building.\n\nSingh was an avid reader of Bakunin, Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky. He was also openly critical of Mahatma Gandhi, having become disillusioned with his non-violent tactics after Gandhi called off the non-cooperation movement.\n\nIn December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in retaliation for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, a popular Indian nationalist leader who died after being attacked by police. On the run from the police, Singh was arrested when he, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, exploded two improvised bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi, showered leaflets onto the legislators below, and allowed the authorities to arrest them.\n\nAwaiting trial, Singh gained public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners. Das died from starvation in September 1929. Singh was convicted and hanged in March, 1931. Four days before his execution, Singh refused to sign a letter drafted for him that would appeal for clemency.\n\n\"Non-violence is backed by the theory of soul-force in which suffering is courted in the hope of ultimately winning over the opponent. But what happens when such an attempt fail to achieve the object? It is here that soul-force has to be combined with physical force so as not to remain at the mercy of tyrannical and ruthless enemy.\"\n\n- Bhagat Singh",

The law helped mitigate decades of anti-union activity, enabled in part by the precedent of court cases like In re Debs (1895), which affirmed the right of the federal government to end the Pullman Strike with an injunction.\n\nThe Norris-La Guardia Act was a precursor to the sweeping National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which established the National Labor Relations Board and is considered one of the most important pieces of labor legislation in the 20th century United States.",

He later earned a PhD in African History in 1966 at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, England, at the age of 24.\n\nRodney traveled extensively and became well-known as an activist, scholar, and formidable orator. He taught at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania from 1966-67 and 1969-1974, and in 1968 at his alma mater University of the West Indies.\n\nOn October 15th, 1968, the government of Jamaica declared Rodney a \"persona non grata\" and banned him from the country. Following his dismissal by the University of the West Indies, students and poor people in West Kingston protested, leading to the \"Rodney Riots\", which caused six deaths and millions of dollars in damages.\n\nIn 1972, Rodney published \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa\". Historian Melissa Turner describes the work this way: \"A brutal critique of long-standing and persistent exploitation of Africa by Western powers, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa remains a powerful, popular, and controversial work in which Rodney argued that the early period of African contact with Europe, including the slave trade, sowed the seeds for continued African economic underdevelopment and had dramatically negative social and political consequences as well. He argued that, while the roots of Africa\u2019s ailments rested with intentional underdevelopment and exploitation under European capitalist and colonial systems, the only way for true liberation to take place was for Africans to become cognizant of their own complicity in this exploitation and to take back the power they gave up to the exploiters.\"\n\nOn June 13th, 1980, Rodney was killed in Georgetown, Guyana via a bomb given to him by Gregory Smith, a sergeant in the Guyana Defence Force, one month after returning Zimbabwe. In 2015, a \"Commission of Inquiry\" in Guyana that the country's then president, Linden Forbes Burnham, was complicit in his murder.\n\n\"If there is to be any proving of our humanity it must be through revolutionary means.\"\n\n- Walter Rodney",

The bombings lasted until June 10th of that year.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) bombing campaign was its first military action taken without the endorsement of the U.N. Security Council. James Byron Bissett, former Canadian ambassador to Yugoslavia, called the campaign a \"war crime\", and Noam Chomsky referred to it as an act of \"terrorism\".\n\nSupporters for the campaign claimed the bombing was necessary to stop a genocide of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and to remove Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 from power, although claims made by the Clinton administration along these lines were later found to be highly exaggerated.\n\nApproximately 500 of the people killed were civilians, and the bombs damaged many civilian structures alongside legitimate military targets. Chomsky has argued that the main objective of the NATO intervention was to integrate Yugoslavia into the Western neoliberal social and economic system.\n\nIn 2000, Michael Parenti authored \"To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugoslavia\", which argues that the bombing was predicated on capitalist rather than humanitarian interests.",

He has served as DiEM25's Secretary-General of DiEM25 since 2018.\n\nIn January 2015, Varoufakis was appointed Minister of Finance in Greece. He led tense negotiations with Greece's creditors during the government-debt crisis, but failed to reach an agreement with the European troika (European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund), leading to the 2015 bailout referendum.\n\nThe referendum rejected the troika bailout terms, and the day afterwards Varoufakis resigned as Minister of Finance, being replaced by Euclid Tsakalotos. Varoufakis has since appeared in numerous debates, lectures and interviews, describing in detail what he sees as corruption and anti-democratic governance within the European Union.\n\nIn February 2016, Varoufakis launched the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25). In the 2019 legislative election, DiEM25 amassed nine parliamentary seats, with Varoufakis himself returning to the Hellenic Parliament.\n\nToday, DiEM25 has 138,000 members around the world. In December 2018, Varoufakis also launched the \"Progressive International\" with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nOn March 10th, 2023, Varoufakis was physically attacked while dining in Athens with DiEM25 associates in what the party condemned as a \"brazen fascist attack\".\n\n\"My reason for writing [this book] was the conviction that the economy is too important to leave to the economists.\"\n\n- Yanis Varoufakis, on writing \"Talking to My Daughter About the Economy\"",

Although initially perceived as a conservative, Romero became an activist after the assassination of his friend and fellow priest Rutilio Grande in 1977.\n\nDuring the civil war, Romero was a prominent figure in El Salvador, giving popular radio sermons in which he reported disappearances, tortures, murders, and other repressed information each Sunday. In a media landscape that was heavily censored, Romero became an important source of news for what was going on in the country. According to listener surveys, 73% of the rural population and 47% of the urban listened regularly.\n\nIn 1980, Romero was assassinated while celebrating Mass in the chapel of the Hospital of Divine Providence, the day after he gave a sermon urging soldiers to listen to \"God's orders\" and desert their ranks rather than continuing to oppress the domestic population. Romero's funeral was interrupted by smoke bombs and rifle shots from surrounding buildings that were fired into the mourning crowd, killing dozens.\n\nIn 2000, The Guardian named Oscar Perez Linares as the assassin, using declassified CIA documents as evidence. Investigations by the UN-created \"Truth Commission for El Salvador\" concluded that the extreme right-wing politician and death squad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson had given the order to kill Romero. Both died before being brought to justice for their role in Romero's murder.\n\n\"A church that doesn't provoke any crises, a gospel that doesn't unsettle, a word of God that doesn't get under anyone's skin, a word of God that doesn't touch the real sin of the society in which it is being proclaimed\u2009\u2014\u2009\u200bwhat gospel is that?\"\n\n- \u00d3scar Romero",

While organizing for revolution in Mexico, Mella was assassinated by an unknown assailant.\n\nBorn in Havana in 1903, Mella developed an interest in politics as a young adult, first getting arrested during the government of Alfredo Zayas (1921 - 1924). Mella had studied law in the University of Havana, but was expelled in 1925.\n\nAlthough Cuba already had various anti-capitalist parties, Julio Mella helped found the \"international\" Cuban Communist Party, recognized by the Soviet Union in 1925, during the Machado regime.\n\nAt the time of his murder, Mella was working as a Marxist revolutionary in Mexico, collaborating with other exiles and supporters to organize the overthrow of General Gerardo Machado in Cuba.\n\nMella was assassinated on January 10th, 1929, while walking home at night with revolutionary photographer Tina Modotti. It is unknown who killed Mella, as both Machado and the Cuban Communist Party, which was afraid Mella had come under the influence of Trotsky (who lived in Mexico at the time), had cause to assassinate him.\n\nThe Cuban government's official position is that Machado had Mella assassinated, while also conceding that Modotti was a Stalin-aligned agent. On September 29th, 1933 the troops of Fulgencio Batista, less than a month in power, broke up a procession to bury his ashes in Havana, shooting as many as six people.",

        "description": "On this day in 1931, the Scottsboro Boys were falsely accused of raping white women after fending off a group of white attackers, leading to a national scandal involving lynch mobs, Supreme Court appeals, and the Communist Party.\n\nThe Scottsboro Boys were nine African American teenagers, ages 13 to 19, falsely accused in Alabama of raping two white women on a train. The accusers were a group of young white men who were fought off by the Scottsboro Boys after they attacked and tried to remove them from the train.\n\nA landmark set of legal cases came out of the Scottsboro Boys case, dealing with systemic racism and the right to a fair trial. The U.S. Supreme Court was compelled to force the state of Alabama to let black people serve on the trial's jury, leading to multiple sets of trials.\n\nOther incidents included lynch mobs, formed before the suspects could even be indicted, rushed trials, and disruptive mobs. The Scottsboro Boys case is commonly cited as an example of a miscarriage of justice in the United States legal system.\n\nInitially, all but the youngest, 13 year old Roy Wright, were convicted of rape and sentenced to death. With help from the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the case was appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court, which affirmed seven of the eight convictions. The cases were then appealed twice to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ordered new trials due to the exclusion of black people from juries (Norris v. Alabama) and violation of due process (Powell v. Alabama).\n\nIn the subsequent re-trials, Creed Conyer was selected as the first black person since Reconstruction to sit on an Alabama grand jury. Despite the successful legal appeals, most of the Scottsboro Boys were convicted on charges of rape or sexual assault.\n\nThe legal aid of the Communist Party impressed some poor black sharecroppers in the South, leading to increased black participation in the party there (prominent examples include Ned Cobb and Hosea Hudson).\n\nClarence Norris, the only defendant ultimately sentenced to death, \"jumped parole\" in 1946 and went into hiding. He was found in 1976 and pardoned by Governor George Wallace. Norris later wrote a book about his experiences, \"The Last of the Scottsboro Boys: An Autobiography\", and died in 1989, the last surviving defendant.",

        "description": "On this day in 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire took place in New York City. Managers had locked the exits to prevent theft and unauthorized breaks; the fire killed 146 garment workers, mostly young immigrant girls. It was the deadliest industrial disaster in the history of the city, and one of the deadliest in U.S. history.\n\nThe fire caused the deaths of 146 garment workers - 123 women and girls and 23 men - who either burned to death, choked on smoke, or jumped to their deaths from high windows. Most of the victims were recent Italian and Jewish immigrant women and girls aged 14 to 23.\n\nThe death toll was high in part because the doors to the stairwells and exits were locked (a then-common practice to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks and to reduce theft). The incident led to legislation requiring improved factory safety standards and helped spur the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which fought for better working conditions for sweatshop workers.\n\nThe owners (who survived the fire by fleeing to the roof when it began), were acquitted of manslaughter charges, but found liable for wrongful death. Although they had to pay out $75 per victim killed, their insurance provider paid them out $400 per casualty. Two years later, one of the owners was arrested and fined $20 for again locking his doors during factory hours.\n\nA week later, on April 2nd, 1911, Rose Schneiderman, a prominent socialist, feminist, and union activist, spoke to workers, saying this about the incident: \"I would be a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people of the public and we have found you wanting...I know from my experience it is up to the working people to save themselves. The only way they can save themselves is by a strong working-class movement.\"",

While incarcerated, O'Hare met the anarchists Emma Goldman and Gabriella Segata Antolini, working with them to improve prison conditions.\n\nIn April 1922, she joined a national march to release other activists also convicted of violating the 1917 Espionage Act. With support of the fledgling ACLU, women and children stood at the gates of the White House for almost two months before President Harding met with them.\n\nLike some other white socialist contemporaries, such as Victor L. Berger, Kate O'Hare was a white supremacist and supporter of racial segregation. In a pamphlet whose title contained a racial slur, she wrote: \"In Kansas City black men have replaced white men in the packinghouses wherever possible, and the white daughters of both Republican and Democratic voters are forced to associate with them in terms of shocking intimacy. In the coal mines of the whole United States black men have been used to replace white miners until there is not a shred of race distinction left.\"\n\n\"Thank God that at this hour I am dangerous to the war profiteers of this country who rob the people on the one hand, and rob and debase the government on the other; and then with their pockets and wallets stuffed with the filthy, bloodstained profits of war, wrap the sacred folds of the Stars and Stripes about them and [about] their blatant hypocrisy to the world.\"\n\n- Kate O'Hare",

The bombing was a partial success, destroying 15% of the records, around 800,000 in total.\n\nFollowing the 1940 German invasion and occupation of the Netherlands, everyone aged 15 and older was required to carry an identification card, the \"persoonsbewijs\", with them at all times. Resistance members soon started to forge identification cards at a large scale \u2013 the largest such operation, led by sculptor Gerrit van der Veen, produced some 80,000 forged documents. Forged documents could be easily detected, however, because they could be compared against the records in the civil registries.\n\nDisguised in police uniforms, the resistance group approached the security guards and told them that they had come to search the building for explosives. Believing their story, the guards let them in. Two medical students then sedated the guards by injecting them with phenobarbital. While inside the building, the saboteurs then set the building on fire with a series of timed explosions.\n\nFollowing the bombing, the Nazis immediately offered a 10,000 guilder reward to whomever could identify the perpetrators of the assault. Within a week, most of the conspirators had been betrayed to the Nazis and arrested, including resistance leader and openly gay man Willem Arondeus, who was executed along with twelve others. Arondeus' last words were \"Tell the world that gays are no less courageous than anyone else.\"",

Out of 485,000 registered voters, more than 230,000 voted. Participation was significantly higher in working class neighborhoods than bourgeois ones.\n\nOn March 27th, the Commune was formally declared. Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray, a participant of the Commune and author of \"History of the Paris Commune of 1871\", describes the celebration:\n\n\"The next day 200,000 'wretches' came to the H\u00f4tel-de-Ville there to install their chosen representatives, the battalion drums beating, the banners surmounted by the Phrygian cap and with red fringe round the muskets; their ranks, swelled by soldiers of the line, artillerymen, and marines faithful to Paris, came down from all the streets to the Place de Greve like the thousand streams of a great river...\n\nA member of the Committee announced the names of those elected. The drums beat a salute, the bands and two hundred thousand voices chimed in with the Marseillaise. [Gabriel] Ranvier, in an interval of silence, cried out, 'In the name of the People the Commune is proclaimed.'\n\nA thousandfold echo answered, 'Vive la Commune!' Caps were flung up on the ends of bayonets, flags fluttered in the air. From the windows, on the roofs, thousands of hands waved handkerchiefs...The quick reports of the cannon, the bands, the drums, blended in one formidable vibration. All hearts leaped with joy, all eyes filled with tears.\"\n\nThe government of the Paris Commune developed a set of policies that tended towards a progressive, secular, and highly democratic social democracy, although its existence was too brief to implement them with much permanence. Among these policies were the separation of church and state, abolition of child labor, abolishment of interest on some forms of debt, as well as the right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if it was deserted by its original owner.\n\nThe national French Army suppressed the Commune at the end of May during La semaine sanglante (\"The Bloody Week\"), beginning on May 21st, 1871. Even after the Commune was defeated, the Army continued their campaign of slaughter.\n\nIn an 1886 account of the Paris Commune, The Socialist League wrote \"Thus was extinguished the despair of Paris; but though the fighting was over, the killing went on merrily; for instance, in the prison of La Roquette alone nine hundred prisoners were slain in cold blood, and without any pretence of form of trial. The courts martial disposed of others. 'Have you taken arms, or served the Commune? Show your hands.' If the judge thought the man looked likely, 'class\u00e9' was the word; if anyone was spared, \u201cordinaire\u201d was pronounced, and he was kept for Versailles. None were released \u2014 sex or age made no difference. Those who were 'class\u00e9s' were shot at once; perhaps they were not the unluckiest.\"\n \nA watershed moment in revolutionary working class history, the Paris Commune was analyzed by many communist thinkers, including Karl Marx, who identified it as a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" Vladimir Lenin danced in the snow in celebration when the newly formed Bolshevik government lasted longer than the Paris Commune.\n\n\"It is time people understood the true meaning of this Revolution; and this can be summed up in a few words\u2026It was the first attempt of the proletariat to govern itself. The workers of Paris expressed this when in their first manifesto they declared they 'understood it was their imperious duty and their absolute right to render themselves masters of their own destinies by seizing upon the governmental power.'\"\n\n- Eleanor Marx",

        "description": "On this day in 1981, the largest strike in USSR history began when 12-14 million Poles went on a four-hour national strike to protest police brutality and political repression, threatening a prolonged general strike.\n\nIn the early spring of 1981, several members of \"Solidarity\", a very large trade union movement independent of state control, were beaten by state security services when they refused to leave a session of negotiations regarding a Solidarity strike.\n\nThe incidents became known as the \"Bydgoszcz Events\", and political tensions increased when the Polish government downplayed or outright denied being responsible the injuries sustained by the involved Solidarity members.\n\nSolidarity made several demands, including the immediate punishment of officials responsible for the Bydgoszcz incident, legal permission for peasants to form their own union, annulment of a government directive giving only half pay to strikers, and the closing of all pending cases against people arrested for political opposition to government policies between 1976 and 1980.\n\nIf no agreement between the government and Solidarity could be reached by March 31st, Solidarity planned to instigate a general strike. As a kind of \"warning shot\" to the state, nearly all Polish workers went on a 4-hour strike on March 27th, 1981.\n\nWorkers set up guard around occupied factories, and people still on their job wore red and white armbands to express solidarity with those who were striking. During the four hours of protest, television screens in Poland showed the words \"Solidarity-Strike\"\n\nSolidarity and the Polish government came to an agreement after this episode, and the general strike planned for March 31st was averted. The government conceded to demands about police brutality and admitted to mishandling the Bydgoszcz Events. In return, Solidarity leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa agreed to postpone the general strike.\n\nIn the following years, Solidarity secretly received millions of dollars from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), also openly accepting money from the anti-communist AFL-CIO.\n\nSolidarity would go on to play a key role in the liberalization of Poland. By the end of August 1989, Poland was governed by a liberal, Solidarity-led coalition, with one of its leaders, the anti-communist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, serving as the first liberal Prime Minister in Eastern Europe for nearly 40 years.",

The act of rebellion began when at least three armed people climbed a high well and entered the guardhouse early in the morning of March 27th, 1993.\n\nThe group subdued ten prison guards and locked them in a van near a landfill. After that, the RAF members brought in more than 200 kilograms of explosives, detonating them at 5:12 am. The prison had to be rebuilt, which took another four years, opening and receiving inmates in May 1997.\n\nThe bombing was the last major action of the RAF before they dissolved in 1998. In 2007, fourteen years later, detectives identified three perpetrators using DNA analysis, however all three suspects are still at large. In May 2020, all three suspects were on the Europe Union's \"Most Wanted\" list.",

        "description": "Sergei Kirov, born on this day in 1886, was Bolshevik revolutionary and Soviet politician. In 1934, Kirov was assassinated by an ex-Party member, the catalyst for a series of purges and state repression led by Stalin, sometimes called the \"Great Purge\".\n\nSergei Kirov (1886 - 1934) began his career as an engineer, becoming after in politics after moving to the Siberian city Tomsk, where he became a Marxist and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1904.\n\nAfter the RSDLP split, Kirov followed the Bolshevik faction. During the Russian Civil War, he became commander of the Bolshevik military administration in Astrakhan, and fought for the Red Army until 1920.\n\nIn 1921, Kirov became First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, the Bolshevik party organization in Azerbaijan. Kirov was a loyal supporter of Joseph Stalin, the successor of Vladimir Lenin, and in 1926 he was rewarded with command of the Leningrad party organization.\n\nOn December 1st, 1934, Kirov was shot dead in his office by Leonid Nikolaev, a disaffected and expelled ex-Party member. Kirov was buried in the Kremlin Wall necropolis in a state funeral, with Stalin and other prominent members of the CPSU personally carrying his coffin.\n\nStalin called for swift punishment of the traitors and those found negligent in Kirov's death, announcing that Nikolaev had been put up to the job by \"Zinovievites\" (supporters of Grigorii Zinoviev, who had been ousted as Leningrad party boss in 1926).\n\nNikolayev was swiftly found guilty and executed on December 29th, 1934. Arrests of Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev and many of their associates followed, as did summary executions of alleged White conspirators.\n\nThe circumstances of Kirov's death have been the source of great speculation and conspiracy, particularly by Soviet dissidents. One conspiracy, alleged by Nikita Khrushchev and anti-Soviet defectors such as Alexander Orlov and Alexander Barmine, is that Stalin himself secretly ordered the assassination, fearing Kirov as a political rival and requiring a justification to begin mass purges.\n\nDespite these claims, at least two official investigations, one in the 1960s and another in 1989, failed to establish Stalin's or the NKVD's complicity in Kirov's assassination.\n\nMany cities, streets, and factories were named or renamed after Kirov in his honor, including the town of Kirov (formerly Vyatka).\n\n\"Whenever there is a conflict between precept and example, the latter wins because deeds speak louder than our words.\"\n\n- Sergei Kirov",

The CPP-NPA waged one of the longest communist insurgencies in the world and is deemed a terrorist org by the US and EU.\n\nIn December 1968, Filipino revolutionary Jose Maria Sison met Bernab\u00e9 Buscayno, who had commanded an armed group during a communist-led uprising in the 1950s known as the Huk Rebellion. Together with Buscayno, who still commanded his armed group, Sison set up the NPA on March 29th, 1969, a few months after establishing the CPP.\n\nBuscayno became the NPA's first commander, bringing his fighters into the newly established militant wing. The NPA adopted the Maoist strategy of the protracted people's war, and, according to liberal journalist Seth Mydans, has waged the \"world's longest-running communist insurgency\".\n\nIn 2017, the Office of the President of the Philippines designated both the NPA and the CPP as terrorist groups. The United States and the European Union have designated the CPP-NPA as \"foreign terrorist organizations\" in 2002 and 2005, respectively.\n\nJose Maria Sison wrote extensively about his experiences with revolutionary struggle, authoring texts such as \"Foundation for Resuming the Philippine Revolution\" (1968 - 1972) and \"Continuing the Struggle for National & Social Liberation\" (1986 - 1991). \n\n\"Party members were encouraged to adhere to the mass line and do painstaking mass work.

        "description": "On this day in 1976, Palestinians initiated a campaign of resistance, including a general strike, occupations, and violent confrontation with police, in opposition to Israeli settlement plans. The uprising is commemorated annually as Land Day.\n\nLand Day was not a spontaneous uprising, but the result of months of planning. On May 21st, 1975, activists and Arab intellectuals held a meeting in Haifa to discuss a strategic response to Israel stepping up its campaign to appropriate Palestinian-owned land. This began a series of meetings over which the campaign was conceptualized, including a general congress that was the largest public gathering of Palestinians in Israel since 1948.\n\nOn February 14th, 1976, more than 5,000 residents rallied in the village of Sakhnin, calling for a general strike in response to Israeli repression. To prepare for the strike, local land defense committees and branches of the Communist Party distributed leaflets, organized demonstrations, and held meetings in several Arab towns and villages.\n\nThe first confrontations began on the eve of Land Day, March 29th as demonstrators in Arraba demanded the release of a local activist, closing the streets and setting fire to tires. Israeli soldiers fired on demonstrators with live ammunition, injuring many of them.\n\nThe following day, the general strike was initiated in Arab towns and villages, including the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and refugee camps in Lebanon. Israeli troops and border guards in military trucks and tanks raided Arab communities to arrest activist politicians and disperse demonstrators.\n\nIn total, six people were killed, approximately fifty were injured, and three hundred were arrested. When some of the injured applied for compensation, the Israeli Ministry of Defense categorized the Land Day confrontations as \"combat activity\".\n\nThe Interactive Encyclopedia of the Palestine Question describes Land Day's legacy this way: \"Land Day was a turning point in the orientations and tools adopted for Palestinian struggle inside Israel. After Land Day the Palestinians in Israel gradually structured their presence as a national group inside Israel in a way that went beyond their local struggles.\"\n\nDuring Land Day protests in 2018, seventeen Palestinians were killed, including five Hamas members, and more than 1,400 were injured in shootings by the Israeli Army during a march calling for the Palestinian right of return at the borders with Gaza.",

Workers lived in company homes and the mill owners promptly had them evicted. Workers created a tent city on the outskirts of town, guarded by armed strikers.\n\nOn June 7th, an altercation between strikers and police led to the police chief being shot to death, and several strikers and police were wounded. In the aftermath, 71 strikers were arrested, and mobs of anti-strike community members harassed and shot at striking workers, killing a young woman. Fred Beal and Clarence Miller, another leader of the strike, were indicted and convicted for the murder of the police chief. Both skipped bail and fled to the Soviet Union.\n\nThough largely unsuccessful in attaining its goals of better working conditions and wages, the strike was considered very successful in a lasting way - it caused an immense controversy which gave the labor movement momentum, propelling the movement in its national development.",

        "description": "Alexandra Kollontai, born on this day in 1872, was a Marxist feminist revolutionary who served as People's Commissar for Social Welfare in the Soviet Union and, later in life, as a diplomat for the USSR abroad.\n\nAlexandra was born into a wealthy family of Ukrainian, Russian, and Finnish background, acquiring a fluency in both Russian and Finnish early on. This experience would later assist her in her career as a Soviet diplomat.\n\nIn 1895, Kollontai read August Bebel's \"Woman and Socialism\", which was a major influence on her thinking. In 1896, she helped fundraise in support of a mass textile strike in St. Petersburg, retaining connections with the women textile workers of St. Petersburg for the rest of her career.\n\nIn the years leading up to 1917, Kollontai was active as a Marxist theoretician, educator, and anti-war activist (opposing World War I, specifically). During this time, she established contact with Vladimir Lenin and gave a lengthy speaking tour in the U.S., sharing a stage with Eugene V. Debs and giving 123 speeches in 4 languages.\n\nFollowing the 1917 February Revolution, Kollontai returned to Russia. Later that year, she voted in favor of the decision to launch an armed uprising against the government, also participating in the revolt. At the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, she was elected Commissar of Social Welfare in the new Soviet government.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Women's Autobiography describes her efforts within the Soviet government: \"The changes that Kollontai tried to bring about were enormous, involving the complete destruction of the old system and the creation of a new one...Kollontai authorized decrees that committed the Soviet State to full funding of maternity care from conception through the first year of a child's life - an unheard of measure for the beginning of the 20th century. She attempted to establish full legal, political, and sexual equality for women and to redress the entire marriage code.\"\n\nIn 1920, Kollontai joined the left \"Workers' Opposition\", an opposition tendency in the Bolshevik Party opposed to what they saw as the increasing bureaucratization of the Soviet state. In March 1921, the Workers' Opposition was banned, along with all other factions.\n\nIn 1922, Kollontai was one of the signers of the \"Letter of the 22\" to the Communist International, protesting the banning of factions in Russia. The appeal failed, and a three-man commission, Stalin, Zinoviev and Dzerzhinsky, recommended her be expelled from the party, however she was ultimately allowed to remain.\n\nFollowing this incident, Kollontai began to serve as a Soviet diplomat, becoming one of the first women to work in international diplomacy. Although she initially intended this venture to be temporary, she soon began to regard her work abroad as a kind of political exile, and would spend the rest of her political career in this role.\n\n\"Class instinct...always shows itself to be more powerful than the noble enthusiasms of 'above-class' politics. So long as the bourgeois women and their [proletarian] 'younger sisters' are equal in their inequality, the former can, with complete sincerity, make great efforts to defend the general interests of women.\n\nBut once the barrier is down and the bourgeois women have received access to political activity, the recent defenders of the 'rights of all women' become enthusiastic defenders of the privileges of their class, content to leave the younger sisters with no rights at all. Thus, when the feminists talk to working women about the need for a common struggle to realise some 'general women's' principle, women of the working class are naturally distrustful.\"\n\n- Alexandra Kollontai",

His campaigns used Catholic symbolism, including public processions, masses, and fasts.\n\nCh\u00e1vez would go on to play key roles in pivotal labor struggles such as the Delano Grape Strike and the Salinas Lettuce Strike. Although initially based in California, Ch\u00e1vez began expanding the UFW, working to make it a national organization.\n\nViewing undocumented workers as an obstacle to successful organizing, in the 1970s, Ch\u00e1vez pushed a controversial \"Illegals Campaign\", using UFW union members to spy on and oust undocumented workers, alienating some of his allies in the process. Addressing this criticism, the UFW website states \"Like every legitimate union and labor leader, the United Farm Workers and Cesar Chavez strongly opposed strikebreaking by anyone...When it came to how the union was run and its immigration stands, no American union or labor leader embraced undocumented immigrants and immigration reform earlier and more consistency than the UFW and Cesar Chavez.\"\n\nAlso interested in co-operatives as a form of organization, Ch\u00e1vez established a remote commune in the foothills of the Tehachapi Mountains.\n\nIn 2014, President Barack Obama proclaimed March 31st \"Cesar Chavez Day\" in the U.S., urging Americans to \"observe this day with appropriate service, community, and educational programs to honor C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez's enduring legacy.\"\n\n\"The fight is never about grapes or lettuce.

        "description": "On this day in 1934, the Iraqi Communist Party was founded. In the 1940s, the ICP successfully organized the working class, but was crippled by state repression. The ICP is still active today, participating in the 2018 national elections.\n\nThe Iraqi Communist Party emerged out of a nascent leftist student movement; Husayn Al-Rahhal, sometimes called \"Iraq's first Marxist\", formed the left-leaning group \"Mutadarisi Al- Afkar Al-Hurrah\" (Students for Independent Ideas). A member of this group, Yusuf Salman Yusuf, would serve as the ICP's first Secretary under the cadre name \"Comrade Fahd\".\n\nUnder Yusuf Salman Yusuf's guidance, the party grew with great success over the next decade despite being illegal. The ICP supported strikes and walkouts, its members served as union leaders, and the Party spoke out against government repression. This repression led to Al-Wathbah, a period of urban unrest in Baghdad in 1948 in which hundreds of protesters were killed.\n\nFollowing this uprising, Fahd and two comrades were publicly hanged in 1949 after being accused of organizing agitation from prison. The ICP was further hurt after adopting the Soviet position of supporting a Zionist state in 1948, causing many members to resign and public support to decline.\n\nIn 1953, communists actively resisted the Ba'athist coup that deposed Abd al-Karim Qasim, who had good relations with the Party. Dozens were killed, and a campaign of anti-communist repression followed.\n\nAfter a brief period of legalization in the 1970s, the ICP broke ties with the Iraqi government following another anti-communist crackdown in 1978 and Saddam Hussein's rise to power the following year.\n\nIn 2018, the ICP won more than 1.5 million votes as part of the \"Saairun\" political coalition, gaining 13 seats. Al-Khateeb, a communist teacher and feminist, said upon her victory \"the Communist party have [sic] a long history of honesty - we were not agents for foreign occupations. We want social justice, citizenship, and are against sectarianism, and this is also what Iraqis want.\"\n\nIn 2021, the ICP boycotted the national elections in October, citing \"widespread corruption and the lack of prosecution for the most corrupt\", and stating \"an atmosphere conducive to holding free and fair elections has become nothing but an illusion exposed by the tragic daily realities and the bitter suffering of millions\".",

        "description": "On this day in 1990, 180k-250k people gathered in Kennington Park, London to protest an unpopular poll tax imposed by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, leading to widespread police brutality and rioting. By 1991, the government promised to replace the tax, and the poll tax was repealed in 1993.\n\nThe proposed poll tax was a \"Community Charge\", a head tax that saw every adult pay a fixed rate amount set by their local authority according to Daily Telegraph correspondent Nick Collins.\n\nThe Charge proved extremely unpopular; while students and the registered unemployed had to pay 20%, some large families occupying relatively small houses saw their charges go up considerably, and the tax was thus accused of saving the rich money and moving the expenses onto the poor.\n\nOn March 31st, 1990, between 180,000 and 250,000 people gathered in Kennington Park. A police report completed a year after the riot estimated the crowd at 200,000.\n\nThe rally was met with a large police presence, and rioting broke out around 4pm. By midnight, around 113 people were injured, mostly members of the public and 339 people had been arrested.\n\nRadical left-wing groups in the protest, anarchists and the UK Socialist Workers' Party (SWP) in particular, were blamed by various media and political figures for the violence and property destruction. A member of the SWP Central Committee told The Times: \"We did not go on the demonstration with any intention of fighting with the police, but we understand why people are angry and we will not condemn that anger.\" A 1991 police report concluded there was \"no evidence that the trouble was orchestrated by left-wing anarchist groups\".\n\nThe large scale of opposition and resistance would facilitate Thatcher's fall from power as Prime Minister and Conservative leader later that year, and the poll tax itself would later be abolished entirely, replaced with a \"Council Tax\" in 1993.",

The strike marked the beginning of a period of open rebellion by workers against capitalists and the state.\n\nOn July 5th, TCMC reopened the Briceville mine using convict labor leased from the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railway Company (TCI). Convict labor was heavily racialized; of 120 men brought in to work in the mines at Coal Creek by TCI, only five were identified as white.\n\nOn July 14th, armed miners surrounded the stockades where leased convicts were held and sent them by train out of the city. After repeated attacks on mine property and the stockades where prison workers were kept, the miners burned the prison to the ground and freed hundreds of convicts being held there on October 31st.\n\nOn November 2nd, workers attacked a different set of stockades, freeing the prisoners detained there as well. From these two events alone, at least 453 convicts were set free.\n\nThe strike was forcibly put down by state militia, ending with the arrest of hundreds of miners. All but one were either acquitted or merely fined. Tennessee ended its policy of allowing convict labor to replace mine workers in 1892.",

Among them were the Levellers, often seen as proto-liberal, which supported extending suffrage to all male heads of households, regardless of property ownership. The Diggers (who called themselves the \"True Levellers\"), meanwhile, opposed the seizure of land by private individuals, and sought to preserve and utilize common land for the benefit of the common people.\n\nAccording to British historian J.F.C. Harrison, on April 1st, 1649 a small group of about thirty to forty people began to dig and plant the common land on St George's Hill in Surrey. Over the first few days, their numbers on the hill quickly swelled as they attracted sympathizers.\n\nSoon, however, the protesters found themselves under violent assaults from mobs coordinated by local landowners. The leaders of the Levellers attempted to distance themselves from the \"True Levellers\", making a statement in opposition to the expropriation of estates.\n\nTwo leaders of the Diggers, Gerard Winstanley and William Everard, were ordered to appear before the Council of State in London, where they argued that the land had been granted by God to the common people, and that they were simply claiming the commons in the name of the poor. They further expressed hope that more people would follow their example.\n\nOn the same day, the group published a pamphlet outlining their beliefs, entitled \"The True Levellers Standard\". The pamphlet described private property as the original sin and war as a means which was used to defend the system of property. New Model Army commander Thomas Fairfax considered the men harmless, declining to persecute them further.\n\nWhile St. George's Hill would face regular evictions, the Diggers would persistently return as rebellions appeared in other areas during 1649-50. The Diggers would eventually be defeated and driven from the lands via military force in April 1650. Many surviving Diggers, such as Winstanley, continued to advocate for land redistribution.\n\nThe continuing process of enclosure was a major part of the transition from feudalism towards capitalism. However, the legacy of the Diggers would not be forgotten, as ownership of land remained an important issue for the poor.\n\nThe Diggers would later come to be recognized as proto-socialist, proto-communist or proto-anarchist, and served as an inspiration for radicals in the centuries that followed. The \"Diggers' Song\", a folk ballad commemorating them, is still sung to this day, and was covered by anarcho-punk band Chumbawumba in 1988.\n\nDuring the 1960s, an influential radical theatre collective in San Francisco named themselves after the Diggers. In 1975, a film entitled \"Winstanley\" was released about the movement.\n\nIn 1999, 300 people, organized under the banner \"The Land is Ours\", reoccupied St Georges Hill on the 350th anniversary of the Diggers' commune.",

The trial, which began on this day in 1918, was unusual in the way that the prosecution did not try to demonstrate the guilt of individuals, but rather to indict the IWW as an entire organization. During the trial, prosecutors read inflammatory passages from seized documents; accordingly, the defense testified about the plight of the working man and the evils of capitalism.\n\nAll defendants were found guilty on all charges brought by the prosecution, and many IWW members served several years in prison. Among those convicted was \"Big Bill\" Haywood, a prominent leader of the IWW, however he skipped bail before his sentencing and fled to the Soviet Union, where he would spend the rest of his life.",

        "description": "On this day in 1990, the longest prison riot in British history began when prisoners at the overcrowded Strangeways Prison in Manchester disrupted a religious service, shouting \"Fuck your system!\" and seizing control of the facility.\n\nThe uprising took place in the context of an overfilled prison with abusive guards. On March 31st, there was a 30-minute sit-down protest took place after a prisoner was strip searched and beaten following a visit from his mother. The same day, a black prisoner was beaten in front of other prisoners and tranquilized. The day of the riot, the prison contained 1,647 prisoners, significantly over its capacity of 970.\n\nIn advance, prisoners decided to stage a further protest in the prison chapel on April 1st. A note was passed the night before, reading \"There's going to be a riot in the Church of England\".\n\nOn April 1st, prisoners disrupted the service, interrupting the service with shouts of \"Fuck your system!\". Prisoners donned masks, brandished weapons, attacked several prison guards, and seized two sets of prison keys.\n\nFollowing this, prisoners seized control of large sections of the prison and began rioting. Up to 1,100 of the 1,647 prisoners were involved in the rioting, and by the end of the first day, 700 of the prison population had surrendered.\n\nRioting prisoners occupied the rooftop of the Strangeways facility, communicating with media and crowds below. Prisoners made demands via telephone, including improved visiting facilities, to be allowed to wear their own clothes and receive food parcels, longer exercise periods, and an end to 23-hour-a-day lock-up.\n\nState forces gradually took control over the prison from the lower levels upward, and it took 25 days for the last holdouts on the roof to surrender. In total, one prisoner was killed, 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners were injured, and \u00a355m of property was damaged (equivalent to \u00a3127,801,000 in 2020). One uninjured prison officer died of pneumonia during the riot.\n\nThe Strangeways facility was re-opened in 1994. One prisoner told a visiting journalist:\n\n\"The better conditions in here are not down to the prison department. But for the riot, we would still be in the same old jail banged up all day and slopping out [manually removing human waste]...The rioters brought this about. These conditions...should not have cost the lives of a prisoner, a prison officer, and two huge court trials. They should have done it years ago but it took a riot to get them to do it.\"",

Deutscher is perhaps best known as a biographer of Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin.\n\nDeutscher was born to a Jewish family in Chrzan\u00f3w, in modern day southern Poland, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He first came to prominence as a poet, publishing verse in both Yiddish and Polish, concerned Jewish and Polish mysticism, history and mythology.\n\nAround 1927, Deutscher joined the outlawed Polish Communist Party and very soon became the chief editor of the clandestine and semi-clandestine communist press.\n\nDeutscher co-founded the first anti-Stalin group in the KPP, protesting the party view that social democrats were \"social fascists\". In an article \"The Danger of Barbarism over Europe\", Deutscher urged the formation of a united front against Nazism.\n\nDeutscher was expelled from the Party in 1932, officially for \"exaggerating the danger of Nazism and spreading panic in the communist ranks.\" The Nazis would invade Poland on September 1st, 1939.\n\nIsaac had left Poland for London in April earlier that year to serve as a correspondent for a Polish-Jewish paper. After war broke out, he joined the Polish Army in Scotland, but most of his time in the Army was spent in the punitive camps as a \"dangerous and subversive element\" for protesting against institutional anti-Semitism.\n\nIn 1949, Deutscher published his first major work, \"Stalin, A Political Biography\". Following this, Isaac published his magnum opus, a three-volume biography of Leon Trotsky: \"The Prophet Armed\" (1954), \"The Prophet Unarmed\" (1959) and \"The Prophet Outcast\" (1963).\n\n\"Socialism does not aim at the perpetuation of the national state; its aim is international society. It is based not on national self-centredness and self-sufficiency, but on international division of labour and on cooperation. This almost forgotten truth is the very ABC of Marxism.\"\n\n- Isaac Deutscher, in a 1958 interview with KS Karol, linked below",

        "description": "On this day in 1948, the Korean Jeju Uprising began when 3,350 communists attacked police stations in Jeju, beginning a war with the US government and Korean collaborators that resulted in approximately 15,000 civilians killed, almost all by state security forces.\n\nThe uprising took place following the 1945 surrender of Japan in World War II, ending 35 years of Japanese colonial rule in Korea. In the period following this surrender, \"People's Committees\" formed throughout Korea, localized autonomous councils tasked with coordinating the transition towards Korean independence.\n\nWhen the American military government, the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK), arrived on Jeju in late 1945, the Jeju People's Council was the only existing government on the island. In 1946, USAMGIK dissolved the provisional People's Republic of Korea and their associated People's Committees on the mainland, escalating tensions on Jeju.\n\nIn February 1948, a general strike broke out in opposition to upcoming elections. Participants attacked government installations and fought with police. On March 1st, police fired on a protest, killing six civilians, including a six-year old child.\n\nOn April 3rd, 1948, 500 members of the banned communist Workers' Party of South Korea (WPSK), along with 3,000 sympathizers, attacked eleven police stations, targeting police who had previously collaborated with Japanese colonizers. They also attacked positions held by the Northwest Youth League, a far-right paramilitary which had previously committed violence against workers.\n\nThis incident is generally regarded as the official beginning of the \"Jeju Uprising\", fought between the WPSK and the right-wing alliance of the United States, South Korean collaborators, and the Northwest Youth League. The Jeju Uprising lasted until May of 1949, however communist resistance continued into the Korean War (1950 - 1953).\n\nThe conflict was characterized by brutal violence and mass deaths, in particular from state repression. 14,373 civilians were killed, 86%-90% of whom victims of soldiers and police. Right-wing death squads committed war crimes with impunity, exterminating entire villages, gangraping women, and executing children.\n\nLower estimates of the total killed are 30,000 people, about 10% of the island's total population. The governor of Jeju at the time privately reported the death toll to be around 60,000.\n\nRebels fought back by tactically retreating to bases in mountainous forests and caves. On April 29th, the Korean, non-military, governor of Jeju province defected to the guerrillas, and many police followed. In response, U.S. military provincial governor William F. Dean ordered a purge of WPSK sympathizers from the ranks of the Korean police, and three sergeants were summarily executed.\n\nIn March 1949, Republic of Korea (ROK) forces launched a final eradication campaign, killing 2,345 guerrillas and 1,668 civilians, marking an end to the rebellion. After the Korean War between North and South broke out the following year, the South Korean government rounded up and summarily executed suspected leftists on the island.",

His concept of \"democratic confederalism\" has been influential in Rojava.\n\n\u00d6calan helped found the PKK in 1978, and led it into the Kurdish-Turkish conflict in 1984. For most of his leadership, he was based in Syria, which provided sanctuary to the PKK until the late 1990s.\n\nAfter being forced to leave Syria, \u00d6calan was abducted in Nairobi in 1999 by the Turkish National Intelligence Agency (MIT) (with the support of the CIA) and taken to Turkey, where he was sentenced to death under Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code, which concerns the formation of armed organizations.\n\nFrom prison, \u00d6calan has published several books, including \"Prison Writings: The Roots of Civilisation\", \"Prison Writings Volume II: The PKK and the Kurdish Question in the 21st Century\", and \"Democratic Confederalism\". \u00d6calan also advocates for a form of feminism known as \"Jineology\".\n\n\u00d6calan's philosophy of democratic confederalism, which draws heavily from Murray Bookchin's concept of \"communalism\", is a strong influence on the political structures of Rojava, an autonomous polity formed in Syria in 2011.\n\n\"Without an analysis of women's status in the hierarchical system and the conditions under which she was enslaved, neither the state nor the class-based system that it rests upon can be understood.\"\n\n- Abdullah \u00d6calan",

She exposed poor working conditions of domestic workers in her work \"The Bronx Slave Market\". She was also the first black woman to work at a mainstream, white-owned newspaper.\n\nCooke got her start when she was offered a job as assistant to W.E.B. Du Bois, then editor of the NAACP magazine \"The Crisis\". Du Bois had chosen her for this role on recognition of her writing talent alone - she had no prior experience or education in journalism. In 1926 moved to New York City, settling in Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance.\n\nTo highlight the exploitation of black domestic workers in white homes, Cooke went undercover and got hired in the industry, alongside others who sought domestic work on a day to day basis. She described her experiences in a widely read series for the Daily Compass entitled \"The Bronx Slave Market\", in which she goes into explicit detail about the exploitation of black domestic workers.\n\nLater in life, Cooke was an ardent advocate of Angela Davis. She began working with the Angela Davis Defense Committee in 1969 and volunteered as national legal defense secretary of the Angela Davis Defense Fund in 1971. She also coordinated committee activities in New York and raised money for Angela Davis's defense by organizing a rally at Madison Square Gardens attended by over 16,000 people.\n\n\"As I stood there waiting to be bought, I lived through a century of indignity...'I've always picked nice girls,' she said. 'I knew you were nice the minute I laid eyes on you.' That pat on the back was worse in a way than a kick in the teeth.\"\n\n- Marvel Cooke, in part four of \"The Bronx Slave Market\"",

Some members of the crowd beat down the doors to the Colonial Building, and, when entering it, battled with police, both inside and outside the building.\n\nIn response, protesters began throwing objects through windows and attempted to set the Colonial Building on fire. Prime Minister Squires exited the building, but was found by the crowd, who assaulted him and forced him to take shelter at a private residence.\n\nSquires immediately resigned - while the riot was still going on - and called for new elections. His party, the Liberal Party, won only two seats, with the vast majority going to the United Newfoundland Party.

The group was explicitly revolutionary, eschewing electoralism, and drew recruits from economically alienated youth. In 1970, Wijeweera was arrested following unruly anti-Vietnam War protests in front of the U.S. embassy, and JVP launched the 1971 armed rebellion shortly afterward, while its founder was still imprisoned.\n\nThe revolt began on April 5th, 1971 and lasted until June of that year. The insurgents were able to capture and hold several towns and rural areas for several weeks until they were recaptured by the armed forces.\n\nThe official death toll was listed as 1,200, however other accounts estimate the deaths to be around 4,000 - 5,000 people. The rebellion led to Ceylon severing ties with North Korea, which it accused of supporting the JVP.\n\nIn 1987, the JVP launched another armed rebellion, this one sustained for three years and involving guerrilla warfare and political assassinations.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rohan Gunaratna's research, in this second rebellion, the JVP killed approximately 200 people, including politicians, academics, and military officers, between 1987 and 1990. In contrast, the total death toll of 35,000 - 60,000 is mostly due to violence perpetrated by state-sponsored death squads.",

        "description": "On this day in 1919, socialists declared a new Bavarian Soviet Republic during the German Revolution of 1918-19. Revolutionaries formed a Red Army and expropriated factories for the workers and luxury apartments for the homeless.\n\nThe movement to create this Republic came after the assassination of left-wing revolutionary Kurt Eisner, who had led a \"People's State of Bavaria\", founded a few months earlier. Energized by news of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, Bavarian communists and anarchists declared their own soviet government, with left-wing playwright Ernst Toller as chief of state.\n\nToller was quickly ousted, however, by German Bolsheviks led by Eugen Levin\u00e9. These communists received a blessing from Lenin to make Bavaria a Bolshevik-aligned state (some leftists, such as Kurt Eisner, were deliberately distant from the Bolshevik movement).\n\nThe new communist leadership formed a Red Army from factory workers, seized cash, food supplies, and privately owned guns, expropriated luxurious apartments and gave them to the homeless, and arrested members of the aristocracy.\n\nThe Bavarian Soviet Republic was short-lived, however, as the German Freikorps succeeded in violently crushing the revolution by force on May 6th. 600 people were killed in the fighting, half of whom were civilians. More than 1,200 anarchists and communists were put on trial and several, including Eugen Levin\u00e9, were executed.\n\nLevin\u00e9 himself had opposed the declaration of the Republic initially, thinking that the action was premature and that the revolution would be betrayed by social democrats. Florian Keller, of In Defense of Marxism, quotes him explaining his vote to oppose declaring the Bavarian Soviet Republic:\n\n\"We Communists harbour the greatest mistrust against a Soviet Republic whose sponsors are the Social Democratic Ministers Schneppenhorst and D\u00fcrr, who at all times fought the idea of councils with every possible means. We can only explain this as an attempt by the bankrupt leaders to join the masses through apparently revolutionary action, or as a deliberate provocation.\n\nWe know from examples in northern Germany that the majority socialists [then common name for the SPD] often endeavoured to bring about premature action in order to stifle them all the more successfully. The whole of your approach calls for the greatest vigilance. A Soviet Republic is not being proclaimed by an armchair decision, it is the result of serious struggles by the proletariat and its victory.\n\n...We are preparing for [the Soviet Republic] and we have time. At the present time, the proclamation of a Soviet Republic is extremely unfavourable...After the first rush, the following would happen: the majority socialists would withdraw under the first good pretext and consciously betray the proletariat. The USPD [Independent Social Democratic Party] would join in, then give way, begin to vacillate, negotiate, and thereby become unconscious traitors. And we Communists would pay for your deeds with the blood of our best.\"",

        "description": "Rose Schneiderman, born on this day in 1882, was a Polish-American socialist and feminist of Jewish heritage, and one of the most prominent female labor union leaders of her day.\n\nAs a member of the New York Women's Trade Union League, she drew attention to unsafe workplace conditions following the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911. As a suffragist she helped to pass the New York state referendum of 1917 that gave women the right to vote.\n\nSchneiderman was also a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union and served on the National Recovery Administration's Labor Advisory Board under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She is credited with coining the phrase \"Bread and Roses\" to indicate a worker's right to something higher than subsistence living.\n\n\"What the woman who labors wants is the right to live, not simply exist \u2014 the right to life as the rich woman has the right to life, and the sun and music and art. You have nothing that the humblest worker has not a right to have also. The worker must have bread, but she must have roses, too. Help, you women of privilege, give her the ballot to fight with.\"\n\n- Rose Schneiderman",

The newly formed Republic was crushed by the right-wing Freikorps, and Landauer was arrested and murdered in prison.\n\nLandauer briefly served as the Republic's commissioner for \"Enlightenment and Public Instruction\", but resigned after the German Communist Party (KPD) came into power.\n\nAccording to anarchist author James Horrox, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD)'s Minister of Defence, Gustav Noske, ordered soldiers from the right-wing Freikorps militia into Munich to undermine the Republic.\n\nFreikorps forces broke through Munich defenses on May 1st, 1919, and many left-wing revolutionaries were arrested, including Landauer, Eugene Levin\u00e9, and Ernst Toller.\n\nThe following day, Landauer was brought to Stadelheim Prison, where he was beaten by several soldiers and then brutally murdered as described by an eyewitness:\n\n\"An officer struck him in the face, the men shouted: 'Dirty Bolshie! Let\u2019s finish him off!' and a rain of blows from rifle-butts drove him out into the yard. He said to the soldiers round him: 'I\u2019ve not betrayed you. You don\u2019t know yourselves how terribly you\u2019ve been betrayed.'\"\n\nThe eyewitness describes Landauer being shot repeatedly and trampled. His murderers then stripped the corpse and threw it into the washhouse.\n\nIn 1925, German anarcho-syndicalists built a memorial for Landauer at the M\u00fcnchner Waldfriedhof, destroyed by Nazis only a few years later. A new one was constructed in 2017. \n\nLandauer's grave can now be found on the Neuer Israelitischer Friedhof in Munich. It is shared with the social democrat Kurt Eisner, who had served as President of the People's State of Bavaria, a predecessor to the Bavarian Soviet Republic.\n\n\"Now is the time to bring forth a martyr of a different kind, not heroic, but a quiet, unpretentious martyr who will provide an example for the proper life.\"\n\n- Gustav Landauer",

As a political activist, she was a vocal opponent of World War I and advocated civic and economic reforms, including the women's right to vote and an eight-hour workday.\n\nAfter witnessing first-hand the brutality of police repression of a cannery workers' strike, Equi aligned herself with anarchists and the radical labor movement. While participating in the strike, she was clubbed by a policeman after becoming enraged at watching a pregnant women be dragged away by police.\n\nEqui was also a lesbian who maintained a primary relationship with Harriet Frances Speckart (1883 - 1927) for more than a decade. The two women adopted an infant and raised the child in an early U.S. example of a same-sex family.\n\nIn 1918, Equi was convicted under the Sedition Act for speaking out against U.S. involvement in World War I. She was sentenced to a three-year term at San Quentin State Prison, but was released after ten months.\n\n\"Prepare to die, workingmen, JP Morgan & Co. want preparedness for profit.\"\n\n- a banner held by Marie Equi during a \"patriotic\" parade in 1917",

After fleeing eleven miles north to Lebanon, they settled in Damascus, Syria as Palestinian refugees.\n\nIn 1969, after establishing himself as an author and journalist, he joined The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and, resigned from his post as editor for the magazine Al-Anwar to edit the PFLP's weekly magazine, al-Hadaf (\"The Goal\"). He drafted a PFLP program in which the movement officially took up Marxism-Leninism, a notable departure from pan-Arab nationalist ideology.\n\nOn July 8th, 1972, at the age of 36, Kanafani was assassinated via car bomb by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad for his role in the PLFP, which claimed responsibility for the Lod Airport Massacre.\n\nThe massacre, committed by three members of the Japanese Red Army recruited by the PLFP, killed 26 people, injuring 80 others.\n\nGhassan Kanafani was an influential author, whose literary works have been translated into as many at least 17 languages and published in 20 countries.

Betances is considered to be the father of the Puerto Rican independence movement.\n\nBecause of his abolitionist beliefs, Betances began organizing a series of secret anti-slavery organizations in 1856. Some of these societies sought the freedom and free passage of African descended peoples from Puerto Rico to countries without slavery, while other societies sought to liberate as many of the enslaved as possible by buying their freedom (this included freeing thousands of slaves as infants and baptizing them at the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria).\n\nWhile exiled from Puerto Rico, Betances and others formed the \"Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico\" and began agitating for armed insurrection to establish Puerto Rican independence. The most famous attempt of these was the \"Grito de Lares\", however it was forcibly put down by the local militia.\n\nBetances was known for stating \"Nadie puede dar lo que no tiene\" (English: \"No one can give others what they don't have for themselves\") in reference to Spain's unwillingness to grant Puerto Rico or Cuba any reforms.\n\nDays before his death, the U.S. annexed Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War. Frustrated by the ostensible unwillingness of Puerto Ricans to demand their independence from the United States, he wrote \"And what's wrong with Puerto Ricans that they haven't yet rebelled?\"",

Israel has kept documentation of the massacre sealed, citing security concerns.\n\nThe massacre took place during the 1947-1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine. In the months leading up to the attack, forces led by the Palestinian Arab nationalist Mohammad Amin al-Husayni laid siege to Jerusalem, cutting off the city from military aid.\n\nAlthough war had broken out, the fighting was relatively contained. According to an Arab League general - \"Despite the fact that skirmishes and battles have begun, the Jews at this stage are still trying to contain the fighting to as narrow a sphere as possible...the Jews have not so far attacked Arab villages unless the inhabitants of those villages attacked them or provoked them first.\"\n\nDeir Yassin was a Palestinian Arab village near Jerusalem, with several hundred residents (all Muslim), living in 144 houses. Multiple accounts suggest villagers lived in peace with their Jewish neighbors, particularly those in Givat Shaul, some of whom reportedly tried to help the villagers during the massacre.\n\nOn April 9th, 1948, more than one hundred members of the underground, far-right Zionist paramilitary groups Irgun and Lehi attacked Deir Yassin. The operation took place despite knowledge that villagers had signed a non-aggression pact.\n\nZionist soldiers expected residents to flee rather than fight back. When they encountered armed resistance, soldiers resorted to blowing up houses with explosives and indiscriminately slaughtering all inside. According to eye-witness accounts, the attackers systemically murdered the village population, executing children and reportedly raping women.\n\nZionists paraded captured adult men in the streets of West Jerusalem before returning to the village and executing them. Money, silver, and gold were taken from the victims. In total, estimates of those killed range from 107 to 254, and at least 55 children were orphaned.\n\nThe massacre was internationally condemned, including by Jewish intellectuals such as Albert Einstein. The attack inspired a revenge attack four days after the Deir Yassin massacre - on April 13th, Arabs attacked the Hadassah medical convoy in Jerusalem, killing seventy-eight, most of whom were medical staff.\n\nIn 1969, the Israeli Foreign Ministry published an English pamphlet \"Background Notes on Current Themes: Deir Yassin\", falsely denying that there had been a massacre at Deir Yassin, claiming that the village was the home of an Iraqi garrison, and calling the massacre story \"part of a package of fairy tales, for export and home consumption\".\n\nThe attack caused many Palestinians in the area to flee, and escalated tensions in the civil war. In 1951, an Israeli psychiatric hospital was built on the village itself, using some of the village's abandoned buildings.\n\n\"They are angry with me that I said these things. Let them first be angry at themselves...I was there, I saw the massacre with my own eyes. Why didn't [Israeli military historian Uri Milstein] ever question me about the things I experienced there?\"\n\n- Meir Pa'il, an intelligence officer who provided an eyewitness account to the Deir Yassin Massacre",

Zapata was responsible for defeating and ousting various invading armies from Morelos on multiple occasions.\n\nOn April 10th, 1919, Jes\u00fas Guajardo invited Zapata to a meeting, intimating that he intended to defect to the revolutionaries.

Seeing how people on welfare were treated, she organized those on welfare in the housing project, and in 1963, she founded the ANC, which was one of the first grassroots welfare mothers' organizations in the country.\n\nThis organization later became part of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), with Tillmon becoming the first chair of the NWRO. In 1972, she became its executive director when George Wiley resigned. Wiley had been trying to mobilize the working poor, whereas Tillmon tried to align with the feminist movement.\n\nTillmon's 1972 essay, \"Welfare Is a Woman's Issue\", which was published in the women's magazine \"Ms.\", emphasized women's right to adequate income, regardless of whether they worked in a factory or at home raising children. The National Union of the Homeless used what was called a \"Johnnie Tillmon model\" of organizing, named after her.\n\n\"For a lot of middle-class women in this country, Women's Liberation is a matter of concern. For women on welfare, it's a matter of survival.\"\n\n- Johnnie Tillmon",

Following his death, there were a series of protests and rallies against Golden Dawn throughout Europe.\n\nDuring one protest in Athens, attended by 2,500-10,000 people, anti-fascists marched towards Golden Dawn's central offices and were arrested and beaten by police. On November 1st, 2013, a shooting took place at the Golden Dawn's Neo Irakleio offices in Athens, killing two members.\n\nIn October 2020, sixty-eight members of Golden Dawn were declared part of a criminal organization, and fifteen were convicted in charges relating to Pavlos' murder.\n\nWhen asked about Pavlos' character by Al Jazeera, his mother stated \"You're asking a mother about what kind of a person her son was.

        "description": "On this day in 1968, Rudi Dutschke, a key figure in the extra-parliamentary left opposition movement in West Germany, was shot by neo-Nazi Josef Bachman. Although Dutschke survived the shooting, he died from complications due to his injuries.\n\nBorn in 1940, Rudi Dutschke grew up in post-war East Germany. As a youth, he became involved with the Evangelical Church in East Germany and would later claim religious inspiration for his socialism, tying the idea of spiritual transcendence with societal transcendence.\n\nDutschke's views on socialism, influenced by worker councils during the Hungarian Uprising of 1956, put him in conflict with GDR authorities, and he defected to West Germany shortly before construction of the Berlin Wall began in 1961.\n\nDutschke became influenced by ideas of social provocation proposed by the Situationist International, and joined the Situationist group Subversive Action in 1963. He edited their newspaper and wrote about revolutionary developments in the Third World.\n\nSubversive Action would later join the German Socialist Students' Union, which had formerly been the student wing of the social democratic SPD before being expelled due to being well to the left of its parent organization. After being elected to the political council of the West Berlin SDS in 1965, Dutschke became a major leader calling for student resistance in West Germany, focusing on the Vietnam War in particular.\n\nAs the movement grew, Dutschke's visibility made him a figure of attack from right-wing politicians and press, such as those owned by Axel Springer, which controlled around 67% of West Germany's press market at the time. His family was forced to leave their apartment after it was attacked with smoke bombs, excrement, and threatening graffiti.\n\nIn 1967, Dutschke famously advocated for a \"long march through the institutions\", to join political and media establishments to build power for leftist movements from within.\n\nOn April 11th, 1968, while attempting to collect a prescription for his infant son, Dutschke was shot by Josef Bachmann, a young laborer with ties to neo-Nazi groups. Bachmann shouted \"you dirty, communist pig!\" and shot him three times.\n\nBachman claimed to have been inspired by the assassination of MLK Jr., which had taken place just a week prior. The assassination attempt spawned another wave of attacks on Springer Press facilities by protestors, and the shooting was viewed as a major factor in the rise of the militant Red Army Faction (RAF).\n\nWhile Dutschke survived, he suffered from significant memory and speech issues along with epileptic seizures, and was soon forced to step down from his political roles. He moved with his family to England in 1969, only to be accused by the Conservative Party-controlled UK Home Office of engaging in political activity in 1971 and expelled, before taking up a teaching role at the University of Aarhus in Denmark.\n\nDutschke would later maintain limited political involvement during the 1970s, supporting East German dissidents. His thoughts on the Red Army Faction during this time remain controversial; when RAF member Holger Meins died on hunger strike, he commented at his grave; \"the struggle continues\". However, he grew critical of their actions which risked harm to civilians and people rather than infrastructure and objects.\n\nIn December 1978, Dutschke wrote, \"Every small citizens' initiative, every political and social youth, women, unemployed, pensioner and class struggle movement is a hundred times more valuable and qualitatively different than the most spectacular action of individual terror\".\n\nDutschke died on December 24th, 1979 after suffering an epileptic seizure while taking a bath at his home in Denmark, causing him to drown. Thousands gathered at his funeral, where Protestant theologian Helmut Gollwitzer described him as someone \"fought passionately, but not fanatically, for a more humane world\".",

Under an emergency decree, Chiang then ordered the 26th Army to disarm the workers' militias.\n\nThe union workers organized a mass meeting denouncing Chiang Kai-shek the next day, and thousands of workers and students went to the headquarters of the 2nd Division of the 26th Army to protest. Soldiers opened fire, killing 100 and wounding many more.\n\nThis incident marked the beginning of a prolonged purge of communists from the Wuhan province, and the ensuing violence killed over 300,000 people in less than three years. Stalin offered his support, sending a telegram to the Chinese communists on June 1st, urging them to take up arms against the state.",

While most fled, Swann, the queen of the ball, confronted police while wearing a satin dress, attempting to prevent them from entering.\n\nSwann, enslaved at birth but emancipated after the Civil War, was an early queer liberation activist who was the first American to lead a queer resistance group, to take legal and political action in defense of queer rights (in the form of demanding a Presidential pardon in 1896), and the first known person to self-identify as a \"queen of drag\".\n\nOn April 12th, 1888, Washington D.C. police raided a drag queen ball held in honor of Swann's thirtieth birthday. Many of the guests fled, even jumping from second story windows to escape police.\n\nSwann, however, confronted the police in what was later described as \"a gorgeous dress of cream-colored satin\", vainly hoping to prevent the cops from entering the residence. Author Adriana Hill claims that this incident \"marked one of the earliest documented instances of resistance in the name of queer rights.\"\n\nIn total, thirteen men, including Swann, were arrested and \"charged with being suspicious characters\", according to queer journalist and historian Channing Joseph.\n\nYears later, when William Swann stopped organizing and participating in drag events, his brother continued to make costumes for the drag community. Swann died in 1925 in Hancock, Maryland. After his death, local officials burned his home.",

His administration emphasized decolonizing society and the state, also unsuccessfully pursuing a Pan-Africanist East African Federation with Uganda and Kenya.\n\nIn 1967, Nyerere issued the \"Arusha Declaration\", forbidding government leaders from owning shares or holding directorates in private companies, receiving more than one salary, or owning any houses that they rented to others. In compliance with this declaration, Nyerere sold his second home and his wife donated her poultry farm to a local co-operative.\n\nNyerere's government also aided in liberation struggles elsewhere in Africa, training and aiding anti-apartheid South African groups and helping to depose Ugandan ruler Idi Amin. In 1985, Nyerere stepped down as President and was succeeded by Ali Hassan Mwinyi in a notably peaceful and stable transition of power.\n\n\"Unity will not make us rich, but it can make it difficult for Africa and the African peoples to be disregarded and humiliated.\"\n\n- Julius Nyerere",

MKUltra is the code name given to a secret CIA program of mind control experiments, sometimes involuntary and involving the unethical use of hallucinogens, on test subjects.\n\nThese experiments were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through mind control, and often ran without the test subject's consent or knowledge.\n\nUnder MKUltra, the CIA created secret detention camps in international areas under American control so experiments could be done on prisoners without being prosecuted, hired British psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron to conduct experiments on patient, including dosing them with LSD and putting them in drug induced comas for weeks at a time, and secretly dosed Dr. Frank Olson with LSD after he asked to resign from the CIA, resulting in his suicide.\n\nIn 1973, amid a government-wide panic caused by Watergate, CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed. Most CIA documentation of the project was destroyed, however 20,000 documents survived because they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building.\n\nWe only know about MKUltra today because of this misplaced cache and a Freedom of Information Request filed in 1977.",

The two other rebellions occurred in the Crown colony of Demerara-Essequibo (now part of Guyana) in 1823 and Jamaica in 1831.\n\nThe uprising was led by the African-born slave named Bussa who was born a free West African man, but captured by slave traders and shipped to Barbados. Bussa and his collaborators began to plan the rebellion when the Barbadian House of Assembly was debating a measure to create a registry for all slaves on the island.\n\nThe uprising began on April 14th, 1816 when slaves burned cane fields in the St. Philip parish, a signal to the rest of the island to began the revolt. Over 70 estates were affected, and white people fled en masse to the capital for shelter.\n\nThe next day, martial law was declared, and the rebellion was quickly put down by local militia and British imperial troops. In total, 214 people were executed, 170 were deported, and many others were subjected to flogging throughout the entire 80 days martial law was in effect.",

Although they won reforms, they never succeeded in abolishing slavery.\n\nAlthough there are records of Quakers condemning the \"traffic of Men-body\" as early 1688, this group (predominantly but not exclusively Quaker) was the first official organization to work for the abolition of slavery.\n\nThe organization was re-formed in 1784, renamed the \"Pennsylvania Abolition Society\" (PAS). This version of the group began to grow more influential, broadening its membership to prominent figures as Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush, who both helped write the Society's new constitution.\n\nIn 1787, the PAS unsuccessfully petitioned the Constitutional Convention to institute a ban on slavery. The following year, they successfully lobbied the Pennsylvania legislature to amend the gradual abolition act of 1780, winning reforms like the banning of transporting enslaved children and pregnant women out of Pennsylvania and the sending of slave ships from the city.\n\nThe amended act also imposed heavier fines for kidnapping the enslaved, and made it illegal to separate enslaved families by more than ten miles.\n\nThe group's influence waned in the decades leading up the Civil War amid economic crises and an increasing anti-black sentiment in the region. Despite their efforts at gradual abolition, chattel slavery was not abolished in the United States until 1865.",

Because porters were not unionized, most suffered poor working conditions and were underpaid, despite the industry booming at the time.\n\nAfter years of bitter struggle, the Pullman Company finally began to negotiate with the Brotherhood in 1935, and agreed to a contract with them in 1937.

        "description": "Harold Washington, born on this day in 1922, was a U.S. lawyer and politician who, with the help of the Young Lords, became the first black mayor of Chicago, overcoming a slew of racist fear-mongering and underhanded political tactics.\n\nWashington was elected as mayor of Chicago after a coalition of black-brown unity, including the Young Lords of Rainbow Coalition fame, organized in support of his election, leading to an upset over establishment candidate Richard J. Daley. Due to that coalition's efforts, over 100,000 new voters participated in the mayoral primary.\n\nAfter winning the primary, Washington faced widespread racist paranoia about his possible tenure as mayor, and prominent Democratic Party establishment politicians (such as alderman Edward Vrdolyak) endorsed his Republican opponent Bernard Epton.\n\nAfter winning the general election, Washington promised to be \"fairer than fair\" in regards to the allocation of municipal services, which had traditionally gone to service wealthy white neighborhoods more than poor, inner city communities. He served as mayor from 1983 until his death from a heart attack in 1987.",

The law offered slavers $300 per enslaved person forfeited, while offering freedmen $100 on condition they move to Haiti or Liberia.\n\nThe Act was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln, who was keen on offering slave owners compensation for forfeiting their \"property\" as a means to not alienate border states in the Civil War. Although it was the only time the U.S. federal government gave direct aid to slaveowners, many state governments took the initiative to do so as well.\n\nThe law offered $300 per slave forfeited and $100 to any freed slave, on condition that they move to Haiti or Liberia. Later Lincoln signed a second compensation act into law that allowed former slaves to petition for reimbursement for their own value, but only if their former masters had not already been compensated.\n\nDr. John Rock, a black physician in Boston, said this of the law's passage:\n\n\"Why talk about compensating masters? Compensate them for what? What do you owe them? What does the slave owe them? What does society owe them? Compensate the master?...It is the slave who ought to be compensated. The property of the South is by right the property of the slave...\"\n\n3,185 slaves were freed as a direct result of the Compensated Emancipation Act, and the anniversary of its passing is still recognized as the holiday \"Emancipation Day\" in Washington D.C.",

On that day, 19 slaves aboard the ship mutinied and took control of the deck of the ship, killing one slave trader in the process. The rebels then demanded to be sailed to Liberia, but settled on the British West Indies instead, as the African coast was too far away.\n\nThe mutineers reached Nassau, a major port city in the West Indies two days later. They were detained and the British government considered charging the enslaved with piracy for liberating themselves.\n\nThe Admiralty Court in Nassau differed, however, and ordered the last mutineers to be released on April 16th, 1842, granting the participants of the revolt their freedom.",

Striking workers convinced contracted workers to join them and attempted to prevent AML vehicles from refueling.\n\nBumbuna's local police force called for reinforcements, and an estimated 200 police officers descended upon the town the next day. During a protest, police opened fire on the market and town center, killing a 24-year-old woman and wounding eight others.\n\nPolice arrested at least 29 people who were held for a day before being released without charge, and many alleged they were beaten during their arrest. Three police officers were also injured. Sierra Leone's Human Rights Commission described the incident as resembling a \"war zone\".",

After a few days, the insurgents became overwhelmed by the Cuban army. President Kennedy refused to provide air support for the operation.\n\nThe invasion's defeat solidified Castro's role as a national hero and strengthened Cuba-Soviet relations.

In the text, Lenin called for the abolition of the Provisional Government and power to be given to workers' soviets.\n\nLenin had arrived in Petrograd the night prior, and had previously delivered the content of the April Theses in two speeches - once to a meeting of Bolsheviks and once to a meeting of both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks - before they were prepared in writing and published in Pravda on April 17th, 1917.\n\nThe text contains ten directives, mostly directed at fellow Bolsheviks. In the April Theses, Lenin calls for opposition to World War I, total non-support for the Provisional Government, a new government comprised of workers' soviets, the nationalization of land and banks, and establishing a new communist international opposed to \"social chauvinists\" (such as the German Social Democratic Party).\n\nLenin also offers analysis of the revolutionary situation in Russia at the time, stating that \"the country is passing from the first stage of the revolution - which, owing to the insufficient class-consciousness and organisation of the proletariat, placed power in the hands of the bourgeoisie - to its second stage, which must place power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest sections of the peasants.\"\n\nThe April Theses provided much of the ideological groundwork that led to the October Revolution, which took place six months later when the Bolsheviks initiated a military uprising and seized the Winter Palace.

The incident quickly escalated into one of the worst labor conflicts in U.S. history.\n\nThe event, also known as the Paint Creek-Cabin Creek Strike, centered on the area enclosed by two streams, Paint Creek and Cabin Creek. It is considered part of the \"Coal Wars\", a series of armed conflicts between workers and coal companies from the 1890s - 1930s in the United States.\n\nThe strike lasted for fourteen months, and over 5,000 workers participated. Notable labor organizer Mother Jones (shown) came to West Virginia to support the workers, organizing a secret march of 3,000 armed miners to the steps of the state capitol in Charleston to read a declaration of war to Governor William E. Glasscock.\n\nThe confrontation directly caused approximately fifty violent deaths from armed conflicts between miners and strike-breaking forces, as well as many more deaths indirectly caused by starvation and malnutrition among the striking miners. In terms of casualties, it was among the worst conflicts in American labor history.",

The blast destroyed the front of the house, however Looby survived the assassination attempt.\n\nThe bombing was the catalyst for a march held later that day, in which approximately 3,000 people marched to City Hall in total silence.\n\nOnce the crowd converged on City Hall, they were met on the steps of the plaza by Mayor Ben West, who admitted to the demonstrators that he supported desegregating the lunch counters. By May of that year, lunch counters in Nashville were desegregated.",

        "description": "On this day in 1943, the largest Jewish revolt during WWII began when Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto attacked Nazis attempting to deport them to death camps. Nazis razed the entire ghetto block by block, killing more than 7,000 and deporting 42,000.\n\nThe Warsaw Ghetto was the largest Jewish ghetto in German-occupied Europe, housing approximately 400,000 Jews in 1940. In 1942, Nazi police and military carried out mass deportations, in total around 265,000 Jews, from the Warsaw Ghetto to the Treblinka killing center. By early 1943, the Warsaw Ghetto's population was down to 70,000 - 80,000.\n\nIn 1942, it was abundantly clear to the residents of the Warsaw Ghetto that deportation was a death sentence. Two armed resistance groups were formed that year - the left-wing Jewish Combat Organization (\u017bydowska Organizacja Bojowa; \u017bOB) and the Zionist Jewish Military Union (\u017bydowski Zwi\u0105zek Wojskowy; \u017bZW).\n\nOn April 19th, 1943, the eve of Passover, Nazis attempted another mass deportation. \u017bOB had received advance notice, however, and 700 young Jewish fighters met the Nazi police with resistance.\n\nThe rebels lacked formal military training and were poorly equipped, but had the advantage of waging a guerilla war, retreating to the safety of ghetto buildings and tunnels after attacking. Non-armed residents also resisted by refusing to cooperate with police by refusing to assemble at collection points.\n\nIn response, the Nazi forces, armed with artillery and tanks, began razing the ghetto block by block. According to Benjamin Meed, a Jew hiding in the \"Aryan\" part of Warsaw at the time, the entire sky was red from the ghetto's destruction.\n\nResistance lasted for approximately a month. On May 8th, 1943, German forces succeeded in seizing \u017bOB headquarters, and many of the group's commanders are thought to have committed suicide to avoid capture.\n\nApproximately 7,000 Jews while fighting or hiding during the uprising. Police deported approximately 42,000 survivors who were captured during the revolt, most of whom were shot to death in the Nazi \"Operation Harvest Festival\" (Erntefest). Many Jews (one estimate suggests 20,000) evaded capture and continued to hide in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nResisters knew that the uprising was likely doomed, but chose to fight anyway. Marek Edelman, the only surviving \u017bOB commander, stated that the inspiration to fight back was \"not to allow the Germans alone to pick the time and place of our deaths\".",

The event took place during the Colorado Coalfield War, a period of violent labor unrest in Colorado from 1913-1914.\n\nThe massacre was the culmination of months of labor strife in Ludlow, Colorado. The massacre began with a meeting between an anti-union militia and the labor leader (and former strikebreaker) Louis Tikas. Although Tikas discouraged violence, the strikers, who had noticed machine guns placed above the Ludlow colony, took cover in ad hoc fire positions.\n\nAccounts differ as to who shot first, but a battle commenced between the armed factions, leading to nearly a dozen deaths, including one twelve-year old boy who was shot in the head. After the violence subdued, Tikas and other strikers were also found shot in the back.\n\nThe chief owner of the mine, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., was widely condemned for having orchestrated the massacre. In retaliation, armed miners attacked dozens of anti-union establishments over the next ten days, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard in a 40-mile front from Trinidad to Walsenburg.\n\nAn estimated 69 to 199 deaths occurred total during the strike. Historian Thomas G. Andrews has called it the \"deadliest strike in the history of the United States\".\n\nAlthough the strikers' demands were not met, the event electrified national discussions of labor and had a positive impact on labor rights in the long run.",

This was the second attempt to assassinate Reuther, who was a politically outspoken leader of the UAW.\n\nWalter Reuther was an American labor leader and civil rights activist who helped turn the United Automobile Workers (UAW) into one of the most progressive labor unions in U.S. history. Reuther saw labor movements not as narrow special interest groups but as political vehicles to advance social justice and human rights.\n\nReuther leveraged the UAW's resources and influence to advocate for workers' rights, civil rights, women's rights, universal health care, public education, affordable housing, environmental stewardship, and nuclear nonproliferation around the world.\n\nReuther survived two attempted assassinations and at least one beating from anti-union forces at Henry Ford's factory. On April 20th, 1948, Reuther was struck by a 12-gauge shotgun blast fired through his kitchen window, which nearly killed him. While being treated by his neighbor, he cried \"Those dirty sons of bitches! They have to shoot a man in the back. They won't come out in the open and fight.'\"\n\nReuther's right arm was shattered into 150 bones, and a slug pierced his stomach. Upon receiving blood transfusions, he came down with both malaria and hepatitis. When Attorney General Tom Clark requested J. Edgar Hoover to get the FBI to investigate the shooting, Hoover refused, stating \"I'm not going to send in the FBI every time some nigger woman gets raped.\"\n\nThirteen months later, Walter's brother Victor was shot and nearly killed, losing his right eye in a similar attack. Neither shooting was ever solved.",

        "description": "On this day in 1920, an anti-labor posse, deputized by police, gunned down striking miners in Butte, Montana, shooting 15-16 men in the back, killing one. Workers had gone on strike to demand higher wages and an end to anti-union discrimination.\n\nAuthor Richard Gibson writes that, in a Sunday night meeting, April 18th, 1920, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and the Metal Mine Workers Union called for a strike to improve wages and end the hated rustling card system, a process whereby employers could blacklist union organizers and members.\n\nPickets spread along the Anaconda Road on April 19th to enforce the strike, and some trolley cars were attacked, with strikers turning men bound for work away from the mines.\n\nOn April 21st, the Silver Bow County Sheriff deputized Anaconda mine guards to suppress workers. As nearly 400 unarmed miners marched up the Anaconda Road, they were confronted near the Neversweat Mine by the sheriff, Anaconda Copper Mining (ACM) Company officials, and armed guards. Shots rang out, and armed Company agents shot 15 or 16 unarmed miners, all in the back. One, Tom Manning, a 25-year-old Irish immigrant, died four days later.\n\nAnti-labor press claimed, without evidence, that workers shot first. Despite a massive inquest, no one was ever charged with the murder of Tom Manning. The inquest report included the complete Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx, entered as evidence against IWW members and others involved in the events of April 21st.\n\nIn the wake of the Anaconda Road shootings, federal troops were called to Butte, arriving on April 22-25 as Tom Manning died. Troops were billeted at the Florence Hotel in the 200 block of East Broadway and elsewhere. They did not depart from Butte until the following January.\n\nThe strike and massacre were the last major labor conflict in the area until the 1934 passage of the National Recovery Act allowed outside support to help rebuild the weakened Butte Miners Union.\n\n\"The overlords of Butte will not permit their right to exploit to be challenged. Drunk with unbridled power and the countless millions profiteered during the war, with lying phrases of 'law and order' on their lips, the blood of workingmen dripping from their hands, and the gold of the government bursting their coffers, they face the nation unreprimanded and unashamed \u2014 reaction militant, capitalism at its worst. The copper trust can murder its slaves in broad daylight on any occasion and under any pretext. There is no law to call a halt. In the confines of this greed-ruled city, the gunman has replaced the Constitution. Butte is a law unto itself.\"\n\n- Ralph Chaplin, poet and member of the IWW",

        "description": "Vladimir Lenin, born on this day in 1870, was a revolutionary Marxist theorist who played a leading role in the October Revolution.\n\nBorn into a prosperous family, Lenin was radicalized at least in part after his older brother Alexander was executed in 1887 for conspiring to assassinate Alexander III. He was subsequently expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist government and later arrested for sedition, exiled to Siberia in 1897.\n\nOver the next two decades, Lenin remained committed to revolutionary activity, authoring influential texts such as \"What is to Be Done?\" (1901-2),  \"One Step Forward, Two Steps Back\" (1904), \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\" (1916), and \"The State and Revolution\" (1917). During this time period, Lenin and his wife, fellow revolutionary Nadezhda Krupskaya, moved frequently, living both in Russia and abroad.\n\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917 ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, Lenin returned to Russia from Switzerland and played a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new State Duma government.\n\nA civil war of significant political complexity subsequently broke out, in which the Bolsheviks defeated conservative, social democratic, and anarchist forces to consolidate its own power. Lenin served as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR from 1917 to 1924. In 1918, he survived two separate assassination attempts.\n\nLenin's ideas are foundational to the political tradition of Marxism-Leninism, a political tradition which emphasizes the creation of a dictatorship of the proletariat by means of a revolutionary vanguard party and democratic centralism, in which political decisions reached through free discussion are binding upon all members of the political party.\n\n\"Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.\"\n\n- Vladimir Lenin",

On April 23rd, the principal was lured off campus, the students convinced the teachers to leave, and, in the school auditorium, the students agreed to stage a walk-out. This act led to a lawsuit which was one of five cases considered in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which resulted in segregation being declared unconstitutional.\n\nAfter the ruling, rather than desegregate, the Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors refused to appropriate money from the county school board to the public schools. This refusal, which continued for five years, was part of the \"Massive Resistance Movement\", a Virginia state government policy to block the desegregation of public schools. The school - Robert Russa Moton High School - is now a civil rights museum.",

It was led by AK Chesterton, who was a former member of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF). The National Front was known to engage in racist violence in years prior.\n\nHistorian David Renton describes the opposition to the march as containing both peaceful and radical elements: \"Communists and churchmen addressed a rally at one end of Duckett's Common, [while] a contingent composed of more radical elements in the crowd broke away and subjected the NF column to a barrage of smoke bombs, eggs and rotten fruit.\"\n\nNotably, Jeremy Corbyn, then a local councillor who supported a militant response to the fascist demonstration, was quoted in the Hornsey Journal: \"Why did the police allow the National Front to march through the busiest shopping area of North London, an area populated by several of London's largest immigrant communities?...How much longer must it be before fascism is banned from our streets?\"",

The same day, Roman Catholic bishops declared conscription unjust and called on the Church's adherents to resist \"by the most effective means at our disposal\".\n\nIn the weeks following the April 23rd strike, anti-conscription rallies were held nationwide, with 15,000 people attending a meeting in County Roscommon at the start of May. Despite the conscription law's passage, it was never put in effect - no one in Ireland was drafted into the British Army.",

        "description": "On this day in 1916, revolutionary Irish Republicans initiated the Easter Rising, proclaiming an Irish Republic independent of British rule and battling with the British Army for six days. Sixteen Rising leaders were executed.\n\nThe rebellion was a collaboration of multiple militant Irish organizations, including the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army (ICA), and Cumann na mBan, and an Irish women's paramilitary force. Notable leaders include schoolmaster and Irish language activist Patrick Pearse and socialist James Connolly, who served as head of the ICA.\n\nTogether, this coalition seized strategically important buildings in Dublin. Britain responded militarily, sending thousands of troops and artillery to clash with the Irish revolutionaries.\n\nThe resistance lasted six days before surrendering to the better equipped British Army, and artillery shelling and street fighting left many parts of Dublin in ruin. 3,500 people were captured, 1,800 of them sent to internment camps. 485 people were killed, and more than 2,600 were wounded. Pearse and Connolly, along with 14 others, were executed for their role in the rebellion.\n\nThe Rising was the first armed conflict of a revolutionary period of unrest that began in the early 20th century. In the \"Proclamation of the Irish Republic\", the revolutionaries linked their cause to centuries of struggle:\n\n\"We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government has not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished except by the destruction of the Irish people.\n\nIn every generation the Irish people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty; six times during the past three hundred years they have asserted it in arms. Standing on that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in the face of the world, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent State, and we pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades in arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare, and of its exaltation among the nations.\"",

        "description": "On this day in 1974, the Carnation Revolution took place when a bloodless, anti-colonial military coup in Lisbon overthrew the Portuguese Estado Novo regime which had been waging unpopular wars to maintain its African colonies.\n\nThe revolution began as a coup organized by the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), composed of military officers who opposed the regime, but it was soon coupled with an unanticipated, mass civil resistance campaign. The name \"Carnation Revolution\" comes from the fact that carnations were placed in the muzzles of guns and on the soldiers' uniforms.\n\nThe revolution toppled the Estado Novo government and ended the unpopular Portuguese Colonial War (leading to independence for Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Angola, among others), also starting a political process that would result in a more democratic Portugal.\n\nAfter the coup, power was held by the National Salvation Junta (a military junta), and Portugal experienced a period of political turmoil as conflicting communist, socialist, and right-wing forces competed with each other for power.\n\nPortugal's first free election took place on the one-year anniversary of the Carnation Revolution with the purpose of writing a new constitution. Another election was held in 1976 and the first constitutional government, led by center-left socialist M\u00e1rio Soares, took office.",

Hurst assassinated Lee with a single gunshot to the head in broad daylight, and was forced by local police to falsely testify in court that Hurst acted in self-defense (Hurst claimed Lee attacked him a tire iron).\n\nAfter given this coerced testimony, Allen then talked to the FBI and the United States Commission on Civil Rights in Jackson, asking for protection if he testified about his forced testimony. The Justice Department said they could not offer him protection, and so Allen declined to speak out.\n\nDespite this, on the day before Allen planned to move out of state, he was assassinated on his own property. In 2011, the CBS program \"60 Minutes\" conducted a special on his murder which suggested that Allen was killed by Amite County Sheriff Daniel Jones. No one has been prosecuted for his murder.",

She eventually succeeded James Forman as SNCC's executive secretary and was the only woman ever to serve in this capacity.\n\nRobinson achieved renown for her willingness to fight rather than politely acquiesce to power. Fellow activist Julian Bond has stated that, when a delegation of SNCC staff was told that their African-bound plane was overbooked and told they needed to be delayed, she, without consulting the rest of the group, sat down in the jetway and refused to move. The delegation were given seats on that flight.\n\nIn January 1967, Ruby's health began to decline precipitously around the same time as the splintering of SNCC, and she was admitted to a hospital. She suffered for ten months from a rare blood disease and in April of that year she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She died on October 7th, 1967, aged 25.",

When they arrived and demanded Rhee's resignation, police opened fire on protesters killing approximately 180 and wounding thousands. A week later, professors joined students and citizens in large-scale protests in which police refused to attack the protesters.\n\nThe next day, Rhee resigned and fled the country and found asylum in Hawaii. On May 16th, 1961, following months of political instability, General Park Chung-hee launched a coup d'\u00e9tat overthrowing the short-lived Second Republic of South Korea and replacing it with a military junta and later the autocratic Third Republic of South Korea.",

The members claimed that they were a preemptive self-defense measure against the possibility of attacks from white power skinhead gangs and National Front members, however they were charged with a conspiracy to attack the police.\n\nDuring the trial, the prosecution argued that \"there was no threat in the black community from fascists\", however this assertion was debunked during the proceedings with documented evidence of racist attacks. All twelve UBYL members were acquitted, and the ruling established a precedent that marginalized communities could arm themselves in self-defense.",

        "description": "On this day in 1919, as part of the larger Black Sea Mutiny, French sailors on the Ukraine-stationed cruiser Waldeck-Rousseau mutinied, demanding better food, demobilization of reservists, and an immediate return home. The Black Sea Mutiny was a set of revolts by sailors who had been dispatched to the Black Sea as part of the French, pro-White Army intervention in southern Russia.\n\nAlthough some of the crew already had radical politics, the impetus for outright rebellion came when the sailors learned that Andr\u00e9 Marty, a communist prisoner from another ship, had been brought on board. A crew-led revolutionary action committee aimed both to free Marty and to take the ship into the port of Odessa, Ukraine.\n\nWhen the ship's captain appealed to the \"national interest\" as a means of quelling the revolt, the soldiers replied \"No and never. It's not our job to defend the millions of French capitalists!\" The mutineers threatened to give the ship over to the Bolsheviks if they were not returned to France immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Black Sea Mutiny, which included several ships besides the Waldeck-Rousseau, about 100 sailors were sentenced by French military tribunals, although the majority were rapidly reprieved. For his part, Marty to 20 years forced labor, however he became a leading and successful figure in the French Communist Party (PCF) for nearly thirty years, joining the National Assembly in 1924.",

        "description": "On this day in 1945, Italian fascist Benito Mussolini was summarily executed, likely by communist partisan Walter Audisio, and then his corpse was hung upside down in the Piazzale Loreto, where it was beaten and shot by angry crowds.\n\nBenito Mussolini (1883 - 1945) was the founder and leader of the National Fascist Party who inspired numerous fascist leaders, such as Adolf Hitler, Francisco Franco, and Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, ruling Italy as \"Il Duce\" since 1925.\n\nMussolini's grip on power had begun slipping as the Allies pressed into Italian territory during World War II. On April 25th, 1945, Mussolini attempted to flee Milan for Switzerland after the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale Alta Italia (Committee of National Liberation for Northern Italy) seized control of the city. Two days later, Mussolini, along with other fascist leaders, were arrested traveling in a German convoy near the village of Dongo.\n\nAccounts vary on how exactly Mussolini was killed, but the most commonly accepted version of the events suggest communist partisan Walter Audisio was the person who pulled the trigger. Following World War II, Audisio would be elected to serve in the Italian Chamber of Deputies.\n\nIn any case, the evening of April 28th, 1945, the bodies of Mussolini, his mistress, and other executed fascists were loaded onto a van and dumped in Piazzale Loreto, a town square where fifteen partisans had previously been executed by fascists and their bodies left on public display.",

There, she was hunted by the Gestapo as both a Jew and supporter of the French Resistance. Her son, active in the Resistance, was murdered by French collaborators in 1944, however she survived the war.\n\nFedern was a strong supporter of literacy for women, birth control, and sexual freedom. She wrote: \"Educated mothers relate their own experiences and sufferings to their children; they intuitively understand their feelings and expressions. They are good educators, as they are also friends of the children they educate.\"",

The military action was supported by the Organization of American States (OAS).\n\nThe Dominican Republic had been fraught with political instability since the assassination of dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1961. Although Trujillo brutally suppressed the population, his anti-communism made him a natural ally of the U.S. government. After his death, liberal reformer Juan Bosch became president, but he was deposed in a coup after less than a year in power.\n\nIn the ensuing power struggle, the U.S. was committed to preventing \"another Cuba\" (i.e., a communist revolution) from taking place. On April 28th, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared that he had taken action to forestall the establishment of a \"communist dictatorship\" in the country, providing reporters with lists of suspected communists there as evidence. These lists, however, contained people who were not communists or were in fact deceased.\n\nThe military action was supported by the Organization of American States (OAS). Over the next few weeks, they established a conservative, non-military government, which held fraudulent elections in June 1966. 69% of American people approved of the decision to send in troops at the time.\n\nAccording to Rory Fanning of Jacobin: \"Upon taking power, U.S.-backed leader Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer began funneling nearly all of Dominican Republic's minerals and sugar into the warehouses of U.S. businesses. His three-decade rule was marked by corruption and fraud. Wages plummeted, unions were dismantled, inflation soared, and unemployment hovered around 30 percent.\"",

It succeeded in ending the \"colour bar\" after four months.\n\nThe action was led by four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, who formed an action group later known as the \"West Indian Development Council\". Unhappy with the lack of progress in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association and inspired by Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol to win their rights.\n\nThe boycott drew national attention to racial discrimination in Britain and continued for several months. The boycott was finally resolved on August 27th, 1963, when a mass meeting of 500 bus workers agreed to officially put an end to the \"colour bar\". On September 17th, Raghbir Singh, a Sikh, became Bristol's first non-white bus conductor.\n\nThe Bristol Bus Boycott was influential in the passing of the Race Relations Act of 1965 which banned \"racial discrimination in public places\" and the Race Relations Act 1968, which extended those provisions to employment and housing.",

The superintendent Albert Burch declared that the company would rather \"shut down and remain closed twenty years\" than to recognize the union. He then fired seventeen workers he believed to be union members and demanded that all other union men collect their back pay and quit.\n\nOn this day in 1899, 250 union members seized a train in Burke, northeast of Wallace, and began making their way to the Bunker Hill mine in Wardner, valued around $250,000. At each stop through Burke Canyon, more miners climbed aboard, eventually numbering over 1,000 strong.\n\nUpon arriving at the mine, the men carried 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg) of dynamite into the mill and detonated it, completely destroying the mill. The group also burned down the company office, the boarding house, and the home of the mine manager. The miners re-boarded the \"Dynamite Express\" and returned the way they came.\n\nState authorities used federal troops to commit mass arrests - over 1,000 men were rounded up and put into a \"bullpen\", including some elected officials and at least one sheriff. Most were released within two weeks, although some were held until December.",

According to historian Howard Zinn, these protests continued for fifty-five nights, blocking major thoroughfares and the Sumner Tunnel during rush hour. Quoting the Boston Globe, Zinn wrote:\n\n\"The demonstrators in East Boston were mostly middle-aged, middle or working-class people who said they had never protested anything before.\"",

His enormous collection of primary materials is held by the International Institute of Social History.\n\nMax Nettlau was born in Neuwaldegg (Austria) to an affluent family. Nettlau's skepticism of state authority began at a young age; his memoirs state that, even as a child, he 'somehow considered the supporter of any government system as a seriously defective person'.\n\nFormally, Nettlau studied linguistics, authoring his doctoral thesis on the Welsh language. While a student in London, he became a member of the Socialist League, the only organization he was ever to join according to the International Institute of Social History (IISG).\n\nAs an anarchist activist, Nettlau wrote articles for John Most's Freiheit and befriended famous anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin, Elis\u00e9e Reclus, and Errico Malatesta.\n\nNettlau was an avid collector of materials of social movements. Not just manuscripts by anarchist authors (although original texts by Bakunin became a part of his collection), but the actual pamphlets, bulletins, and papers of social movements themselves.\n\nAmong Nettlau's works as an author are the first major biography of Michael Bakunin, biographies of anarchists Elis\u00e9e Reclus and Errico Malatesta, and a seven volume work on the history of anarchism. A significantly shorter, one volume version is available in English as \"A Short History of Anarchism\".\n\nIn 1935, Nettlau sold his archive (described by the IISH as \"enormous\") to the newly found International Institute of Social History, where it remains to this day.\n\nNettlau died 1944 from stomach cancer in Amsterdam, having fled his native Austria follow the country's \"Anschluss\" to Nazi Germany in 1938.\n\n\"Do I want to propose my own system? Not at all! I am an advocate of all systems, i.e. of all forms of government that find followers.\"\n\n- Max Nettlau in \"PANARCHY. A Forgotten Idea of 1860\" (1905)",

On May 4th, the police attempted to disperse a public gathering in support of the strike and an unidentified person threw a bomb into the police line, killing several officers.\n\nThe police responded by firing on the crowd of protesters. The ensuing violence led to the deaths of seven police officers, four to eight civilians, and wounded approximately one hundred people on either side.\n\nIn a hysterical crackdown, hundreds of labor leaders and sympathizers were detained, many being guilty of nothing more than having political sympathies for labor. Four of them, George Engel, Albert Parsons, August Spies, and Adolph Fischer, were executed by hanging after conviction in a trial widely perceived as a miscarriage of justice. The following day, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, state militia fired on a crowd of strikers killing seven, including a schoolboy and a man feeding chickens in his yard.\n\nMay Day has been frequently chosen by labor activists across the world as a day to initiate strikes, boycotts, and other forms of protest.",

        "description": "On this day in 1866, Memphis, Tennessee police were dispatched to break up a block party of black union veterans and their families. When veterans refused to disperse, a scuffle broke out that led to a city-wide race riot. The violence continued for two days, killing nearly 50 people and more than 75 more.\n\nThe Memphis Massacre began when a large group of black union veterans, women, and children gathered in the street, forming an impromptu street party. Police were sent to disperse the crowd, and, after the ex-soldiers refused to disperse, the four officers retreated and called for reinforcements. The soldiers gave chase and gunfire broke out, killing one officer.\n\nThis led to mobs of white residents, including policemen, firefighters, and city officials, rampaging through black neighborhoods and the houses of freedmen, attacking, raping, and killing black soldiers and civilians.\n\nFamilies were burned alive as their houses were set on fire and the mob prevented them from fleeing. In total, 46 black and 2 white people were killed, 75 persons injured (mostly black), over 100 robbed, and 5 black women testified they were raped.",

        "description": "On this day in 1946, 800 Aboriginal agricultural workers initiated the Pilbara Strike. The strike lasted for more than 3 years before improved working conditions were won, becoming one the longest strikes in Australian history. Today, the strike is considered a major event in the Aboriginal land rights movement.\n\nThe Pilbara Strike took place in the context of slave-like conditions - workers were denied cash wages, paid in supplies of tobacco, flour and other necessities, and those who attempted to escape were whipped and hunted down by police.\n\nOn May 1st, 1946, approximately 800 agricultural workers walked off their pastoral stations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, setting up strike camps. The date of May 1st was chosen not only because it was International Workers' Day but also because it was the first day of the shearing season.\n\nThe strike lasted for more than 3 years, and spread beyond the Pilbara region. Strikers faced severe police repression, with leaders such as Dooley Bin Bin, Clancy McKenna, Jacob Oberdoo, and Don McLeod being arrested on multiple occasions. Aboriginal women played a vital role in the strike, both as workers and in establishing strikers' camps. Daisy Bindi, a Nyangumarta woman, personally led a walk-off of 96 workers at Roy Hill Station.\n\nThe strikers sustained themselves with their traditional bush skills, hunting kangaroos and goats for meat and skins. They also developed some cottage industry which brought cash payment, such as selling buffel grass seed in Sydney, the sale of pearl shell, and in surface mining.\n\nBy August 1949, the Seamen's Union had agreed to blackban wool from stations in the Pilbara onto ships for export. On the third day after the ban had been applied, McLeod was told by a government representative that the strikers' demands would be met if the ban was lifted. Weeks after the strike ended and the ban lifted, the government denied making any such agreement.\n\nAfter the strike concluded, many Aboriginal people refused to go back to working in their old roles in the pastoral industry. Some were able to pool their funds from surface mining and other cottage industry to buy or lease stations, including some they had formerly worked on, running them as cooperatives.\n\nJacob Oberdoo was later awarded the British Empire Medal, but declined to accept it. In 2010, four streets in the Canberra suburb of Bonner were named after strike leaders: Clancy McKenna Crescent, Dooley Bin Bin Street, Peter Coppin Street, and Don McLeod Lane.",

        "description": "On this day in 1967, 30 armed Black Panthers entered the California State Capitol building while openly carrying firearms in protest of the Mulford Act, bipartisan-supported legislation designed to end Panther patrols of Oakland neighborhoods.\n\nInitially, no one attempted to stop the protesters - they entered the building with their guns pointed at the ceiling and a large group of journalists following them in. When six Panthers entered the assembly chamber, where the lawmakers were in session, some legislators reportedly took cover under desks. Police then ordered the Panthers to leave the premises, and they peacefully complied while insisting they were within their legal right to carry.\n\nOutside, Bobby Seale spoke to a crowd of reporters. Here is an excerpt of what he said:\n\n\"Black people have begged, prayed, petitioned, demonstrated, and everything else to get the racist power structure of America to right the wrongs which have historically been perpetuated against black people. All of these efforts have been answered by more repression, deceit and hypocrisy. As the aggression of the racist American government escalates in Vietnam, the police agencies of America escalate the oppression of black people throughout the ghettoes of America.\"\n\nShortly after Seale finished speaking, police arrested the group on felony charges of conspiracy to disrupt a legislative session, although the protesters would later plead down to various misdemeanors instead.\n\nAmong those arrested was the teenager Bobby Hutton, the first recruit and first treasurer of the Black Panther Party. Hutton would be shot and killed by Oakland Police less than a year later, on April 6th, 1968.",

Punishment for the strike fell disproportionately on black workers, with five of the seven fired workers being black despite whites participating in the labor action.\n\nIn response to this and discrimination within the plant - black workers were kept in the lowest-paying and most dangerous jobs, passed over for promotion, and the United Auto Workers union (UAW) would not help them combat discrimination - DRUM was formed to organize the black workers at the company.\n\nIn July, DRUM called for another shutdown of the plant and, this time, more than 3,000 black workers participated in the strike, keeping it closed for over two days. Their success inspired the formation of other Revolutionary Union Movements in other Michigan auto plants and industries, such as FRUM (Ford), CADRUM (GM's Cadillac plant), and GRUM (the larger GM caucus), healthcare workers (HRUM), and UPS workers (UPRUM).\n\nFrom these organizations, seven activists organized the various -RUMs into one umbrella organization with a socialist bent - the League of Revolutionary Black Workers (LRBW).

He had been arrested as the right-wing Freikorps, on orders from the Social Democrat Party, crushed the Bavarian Soviet Republic.\n\nGustav Landauer (1870 - 1919) was a German anarchist and pacifist who played a major role in the creation of the Bavarian Soviet Republic during the German Revolution of 1918-1919. He briefly served as its commissioner for \"Enlightenment and Public Instruction\", but resigned after the German Communist Party (KPD) took power in the Republic.\n\nAccording to anarchist author James Horrox, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD)'s Minister of Defence, Gustav Noske, ordered soldiers from the right-wing Freikorps militia into Munich to undermine the Republic.\n\nFreikorps forces broke through Munich defenses on May 1st, 1919, and many left-wing revolutionaries were arrested, including Landauer, Eugene Levin\u00e9, and Ernst Toller.\n\nThe following day, Landauer was brought to Stadelheim Prison, where he was beaten by several soldiers and then brutally murdered as described by an eyewitness:\n\n\"An officer struck him in the face, the men shouted: 'Dirty Bolshie! Let\u2019s finish him off!' and a rain of blows from rifle-butts drove him out into the yard. He said to the soldiers round him: 'I\u2019ve not betrayed you. You don\u2019t know yourselves how terribly you\u2019ve been betrayed.'\"\n\nThe eyewitness describes Landauer being shot repeatedly and trampled. His murderers then stripped the corpse and threw it into the washhouse.\n\nIn 1925, German anarcho-syndicalists built a memorial for Landauer at the M\u00fcnchner Waldfriedhof, destroyed by Nazis only a few years later. A new one was constructed in 2017. \n\nLandauer's grave can now be found on the Neuer Israelitischer Friedhof in Munich. It is shared with the social democrat Kurt Eisner, who had served as President of the People's State of Bavaria, a predecessor to the Bavarian Soviet Republic.\n\n\"Now is the time to bring forth a martyr of a different kind, not heroic, but a quiet, unpretentious martyr who will provide an example for the proper life.\"\n\n- Gustav Landauer",

On May 6th, more than 20,000 students, teachers, and supporters engaged in a protest march. The march was attacked by police and devolved into a riot.\n\nThe state repression of protesters caused two major left union federations, the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail (CGT) and the Force Ouvri\u00e8re (CGT-FO), to call a one-day general strike on May 13th. More than one million people demonstrated that day.\n\nBy the middle of May, demonstrations had extended to factories, though their demands were different from the students'. Across France, students occupied university structures and up to one-third of the country's workforce was on strike.\n\nThe protests were so widespread and energetic that many political leaders feared civil war or revolution. President Charles de Gaulle secretly fled France to Germany at one point, and the national government at times ceased to function.\n\nRevolution was averted when de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and scheduled an election that the left dissidents agreed to participate in. Revolutionary fervor subsided and the government banned a number of leftist organizations in the following months.\n\nIn the election, de Gaulle's party won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history, taking 353 of 486 seats versus the Communists' 34 and the Socialists' 57.",

It was led by affluent lawyer Thomas Wilson Dorr, who mobilized the disenfranchised to demand changes to the state's electoral rules.\n\nIn 1841, the movement held a \"People's Convention\", where they created their own state constitution, ratifying it and electing Dorr for governor the following year. Although Dorr himself supported giving black men the right to vote, the constitution only enfranchised white men.\n\nOn this day in 1842, members of this movement held an inauguration parade for the Dorr and attempted to create the new government. A \"People's Legislature\" (elected earlier) convened, and Dorr himself led a failed attack on the state arsenal, quickly fleeing the state to avoid arrest.\n\nEventually, Dorr returned to the state and was convicted of treason. Dorrites made a case to the Supreme Court that the \"People's Convention\" constitution was the legitimate one for Rhode Island, but lost the case in \"Luther v. Borden\". This case set a long standing precedent that the Court would not interfere in \"political\" questions, which it would leave to the executive and legislative branches.",

        "description": "On this day in 1926, a general strike in England involving approximately 1.7 million workers was initiated by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in response to coal mine owners proposing reductions in pay for miners the previous year.\n\nThe general strike was broad in scope, including workers from mines, shipyards, mills, and engineers.\n\nStriking dock workers firmly refused to allow any movement of goods on the docks, causing a bread shortage. In response, the government tried to forcibly move flour and grain to bakeries, but were prevented from doing so by the mill workers and dockers.\n\nDuring the strike, there were clashes between police and crowds in many areas and at least 4,000 workers were arrested. There were attacks on busses and trains, including the derailing of the Flying Scotsman.\n\nThe strike was called off by the TUC on May 12th with no guarantees of fair treatment for the miners, whose strike was defeated in October later that year. The following year, the 1927 Trades Disputes and Trade Unions Act was passed, forbidding sympathetic strikes and mass picketing. Civil Service unions were also forbidden to affiliate with the TUC.",

The May Day conflicts were the culmination of strife between various left factions within the Spanish Civil War.\n\nOn May 3rd, a body of 200 police officers went to the Telef\u00f3nica central exchange and confronted the censorship department on the second floor, intending to take control of the building.\n\nThe anarchists, who were occupying the building legally, opened fire from the second floor of the building. Eventually, they surrendered with a cease fire agreement. A crowd gathered, at first believing that the anarchists had captured the head of the police.\n\nThe Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), Friends of Durruti Group, Bolshevik-Leninists, and Libertarian Youth all took firing positions and began taking out previously hidden weapons and building barricades. From this skirmish, battles began in different parts of the city.\n\nSeveral hundred barricades were built. Police units occupied roofs and church towers. The fighting continued for several days and Assault Guards (state police and paramilitary units) in Barcelona and many other towns proceeded to disarm and arrest members of the CNT, FAI, Libertarian Youth, and POUM that had taken part in the riots.\n\nContemporary press estimated the casualties at 500 dead and 1,000 injured.",

Virginia (1946) and Boynton v. Virginia (1960), which ruled that segregated public busses were unconstitutional.\n\nParticipants, women and men both black and white, journeyed into the deep south, testing segregated bus terminals. The riders were often met with severe violence. In Anniston, Alabama, one of the busses was fire-bombed and passengers were beaten by a white mob. White mobs also attacked Freedom Riders in Birmingham and Montgomery.\n\nThese violent incidents garnered national attention, sparking a summer of similar rides by CORE, SNCC and other civil rights organizations, among thousands of ordinary citizens.",

They shouted slogans as \"struggle for the sovereignty externally, get rid of the national traitors at home\", \"do away with the Twenty-One Demands\", and \"don't sign the Versailles Treaty\".\n\nThe next day, students in Beijing as a whole went on strike and in the larger cities across China. Students, merchants, and workers joined the protests. The demonstrators appealed to the newspapers and sent representatives to carry the word across the country. In Shanghai, a general strike of merchants and workers took place, negatively impacting the economy.\n\nIn the years that followed, many Chinese political thinkers turned to leftist politics in the wake of the political upheaval of the May 4th Movement. In 1939, Mao Zedong claimed that the May Fourth Movement was a stage leading toward the fulfillment of his own communist revolution.",

After police began trying to disperse a May 4th rally associated with the strike, an unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at the police. The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers, four to eight civilians, and wounded approximately one hundred people on either side.\n\nIn the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed, eight anarchists were convicted of conspiracy. Seven were sentenced to death and one to a term of 15 years in prison. Illinois Governor Richard J. Oglesby commuted two of the sentences to terms of life in prison; another committed suicide in jail rather than face the gallows. The other four were hanged on November 11th, 1887.\n\nThe trial, widely believed to be a farce, was condemned internationally.

Together with Carlo Rosselli, he organized the first column of Italian volunteers to fight on the Aragon front, which were incorporated into the militia column of Joaqu\u00edn Ascaso.\n\nOn this day in 1937, Camillo Berneri and his anarchist friend Francesco Barbieri were taken out of their apartment by a dozen plainclothes men with red armbands and policemen. The corpses of the two Italian anarchists were later found riddled with bullets.\n\nSome anarchists have speculated that the Soviet Union, which suppressed anarchist movements in Spain, was responsible for the killings.",

Mart\u00ed is the namesake of the Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, a revolutionary organization during the Salvadoran Civil War and contemporary political party in the country.\n\n\"When history cannot be written with a pen, then it should be written with a rifle.\"\n\n- Farabundo Mart\u00ed",

        "description": "Karl Marx, born on this day in 1818, was a foundational political theorist and journalist associated with the philosophy of Marxism. \n\nAmong Marx's best-known texts are the \"The Communist Manifesto\" and the three-volume \"Das Kapital\", in which he set out to define and explain the behavior of the capitalist mode of production.\n\nMarx's political and philosophical thought have had enormous influence on subsequent intellectual, economic and political history, and his name has been used as an adjective, a noun, and a school of social theory.\n\nMarx's critical theories about society, economics and politics - collectively understood as Marxism - hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In capitalism, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production, and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labor power in return for wages.\n\nEmploying a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx concluded that, like previous socio-economic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as socialism.\n\n\"The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.\"\n\n- Karl Marx",

        "description": "Bobby Sands (Irish: Roibe\u00e1rd Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Seachnasaigh, 1954 - 1981) was a militant Irish revolutionary who died from a hunger strike at 27 on this day in 1981, just one month after winning the election to serve as MP to Fermanagh and South Tyrone while imprisoned.\n\nSands grew up in North Belfast, a member of the Catholic minority and in a majority Protestant area. After being threatened at gunpoint and called \"Fenian scum\" by his co-workers at the age of 15, Sands became dedicated to militant politics. In 1972, he attended his first Provisional IRA meeting.\n\nJust a few months later, Sands was arrested and charged in October 1972 with possession of four handguns found in the house where he was living. After being released in 1976, he continued his work with the IRA.\n\nIn 1976, Sands and fellow IRA member Joe McDonnell bombed the Balmoral Furniture Company in Dunmurry and engaged in a shootout with police. Sands was captured and sentenced to 14 years in prison.\n\nUndeterred, Sands continued his resistance in prison. He refused to wear a prison uniform, and was kept in his cell naked without access to bedding for 13 hours a day. While in prison, Sands authored poems and songs, published by Republican magazines.\n\nOn March 1st, 1981, Sands initiated a hunger strike in collaboration with other inmates. The demands of the hunger strike included the right to not have to do prison work, the right to not wear a prison uniform, and full restoration of remission lost through protest.\n\nSands narrowly won a special election to serve as MP of Fermanagh and South Tyrone on April 9th, 1981, more than a month into the hunger strike. In response, the British government introduced the \"Representation of the People Act\", which prevents prisoners serving jail terms of more than one year in the UK from being nominated as candidates in British elections.\n\nLess than a month after winning this election, Sands died in prison at the age of 27. More than 100,000 people lined the route of Sands' funeral, and he was buried in the New Republican Plot, alongside 76 others.\n\n\"They have nothing in their whole imperial arsenal that can break the spirit of one Irishman who doesn't want to be broken.\"\n\n- Bobby Sands",

The prosecution case rested heavily on Herndon's possession of \"communist literature\", which police found in his hotel room.\n\nHerndon was defended by the International Labor Defense, the legal arm of the Communist Party. Over a five-year period, Herndon's case twice reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that Georgia's insurrection law was unconstitutional, as it violated First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly.\n\nHerndon became nationally prominent because of his case and his defense attorney, Benjamin Davis, was radicalized because of it. He is also remembered for his essay entitled \"You Cannot Kill the Working Class\". By the end of the 1940s, he left the Communist Party and moved to the Midwest, living there in peace.\n\n\"You may succeed in killing one, two, even a score of working-class organizers.

After Paris was seized by revolutionaries in March 1871, Ferr\u00e9 served on the Commune's Committee of Public Safety, a body given extensive powers to hunt down enemies of the Commune.\n\nOn April 5th, the Commune passed a decree that authorized the arrest of any person thought to be loyal to the French government in Versailles, to be held as hostages. Prominent figures arrested included a Catholic priest Georges Darboy and the archbishop of Paris. The Commune hoped to exchange their hostages for Louis-Auguste Blanqui, a revolutionary and honorary President of the Commune, imprisoned by the state.\n\nFollowing the events of the \"Bloody Week\", in which the French government summarily executed many suspected Communards, Ferr\u00e9 authorized the execution of several hostages, including Darboy and the archbishop.\n\nAfter the resistance of the Commune collapsed, Ferr\u00e9 was captured by the army, tried by a military court, and sentenced to death. On November 28th, 1871, he was shot at Satory, an army camp southwest of Versailles. He was the first of twenty-five Communards to be executed for their role in the Paris Commune.",

The strike continued through the rest of May but faced repression from the police. The strike officially ended on June 25th, 1912 without legal recognition for the IWW created Hotel Workers' International Union. Despite this failure, hotel workers would go on strike again in 1913, 1918, 1929, and 1934.",

        "description": "John Brown, born on this day in 1800, was a militant abolitionist who advocated for and practiced armed insurrection to overthrow the system of slavery in the U.S. He became the first American executed for treason after raiding Harpers Ferry.\n\nBrown first gained national attention when he led small groups of volunteers during the Bleeding Kansas crisis of 1856. He was dissatisfied with the pacifism of the organized abolitionist movement, stating \"These men are all talk. What we need is action - action!\"\n\nIn October 1859, Brown led a raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (modern day West Virginia), intending to start a liberation movement that would spread south through the mountainous regions of Virginia and North Carolina.\n\nAlthough Brown's group successfully seized the armory at first, his raid was defeated by a combination of volunteer militia and state forces led by Robert E. Lee, who later commanded the Confederate States Army. Seven people were killed, two of whom were Brown's sons Oliver and Watson, and at least ten more were injured.\n\nBrown had intended to arm enslaved people with weapons from the armory, but only a small number of locals were willing to join him, possibly due to an unfamiliarity with firearms. Within 36 hours, those of Brown's men who had not fled were killed or captured by local farmers, militiamen, or U.S. Marines.\n\nBrown was hastily tried for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, the murder of five men, and inciting a slave insurrection. He was found guilty on all counts and was hanged, becoming the first person executed for treason in the history of the United States.\n\n\"I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land can never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed, it might be done.\"\n\n- John Brown",

The ranks of longshoremen were soon strengthened by the other craft workers in the marine industries, including sailors, engineers, firemen, and other workers.\n\nAt its height, almost 35,000 West Coast maritime workers participated in the strike, and, for four days in July, 130,000 workers in San Francisco held a general strike in solidarity with the maritime workers.\n\nThe strike lasted until October of 1934, and labor unions were granted significantly more power over the hiring and working conditions of the docks. During the striking months, nine people were killed, hundreds were arrested, and the clampdown on shipping cost the waterfront employers an estimated $45 million.\n\nThe ILWU continues to recognize \"Bloody Thursday\" (July 5th, when police officers shot into a crowd of strikers) by shutting down all West Coast ports in honor of all the workers killed by police during the strike.",

        "description": "Albert \"Ginger\" Goodwin, born on this day in 1887 and nicknamed for his bright red hair, was a Canadian socialist and labor activist whose murder by police while protesting conscription led to the first general strike in Canada.\n\nBorn in Yorkshire, England on May 10th, 1887, Goodwin immigrated to Canada in 1909, at the age of 19, working as a coal miner in Nova Scotia.\n\nIn Canada, he organized with the Socialist Party of Canada and became a notable labor leade during the 1912\u20131914 Coal Miner's Strike against Canadian Collieries. Following the strike, he was blacklisted and was forced to move away from Cumberland to find work.\n\nIn 1916, he joined the Mining and Smelter workers Union and was elected as Secretary for the Trail chapter. Following his involvement with trade unions, Goodwin entered politics running as a candidate for the Socialist Party of Canada in the 1916 British Columbian election, although he did not win.\n\nAs World War I broke out, Goodwin became an outspoken advocate against the draft, initially refusing to sign up. Eventually, he was compelled to be drafted, and, after exhausting multiple appeals against his conscription, he fled into the hills of Cumberland, British Columbia.\n\nOn July 27th (some sources say July 26th), Goodwin was shot and killed by a member of the Dominion Police, who had ventured into the hills surrounding Comox Lake to locate men evading the draft and arrest them for their evasion. The officer who killed Goodwin successfully claimed self-defense in court, although it is unknown how the two actually encountered each other.\n\nIn protest to his murder, the first general strike in Canada, the Vancouver General Strike, took place on August 2nd, 1918. In 2015, a film about his life titled \"Goodwin's Way\" was released.\n\n\"War is simply part of the process of Capitalism. Big financial interests are playing the game. They'll reap the victory, no matter how the war ends.\"\n\n- Albert Goodwin",

In 1905, Levin\u00e9 returned to Russia to participate in the failed revolution of 1905 against the Tsar and was arrested and exiled to Siberia.\n\nAfter World War I ended, Levin\u00e9 joined the Communist Party of Germany and helped to create a socialist republic in Bavaria. Levin\u00e9 eventually rose to power as the communists assumed control of the government.\n\nHe attempted to pass many reforms, such as giving the more luxurious flats to the homeless and giving workers control and ownership of factories. Levin\u00e9 also planned reforms for the education system and to abolish paper money, but did not get the chance to complete either.\n\nThe German Army, assisted by the right-wing Freikorps paramilitary invaded and quickly conquered Munich on May 3rd, 1919. Levin\u00e9 himself was arrested and shot by firing squad in Stadelheim Prison.\n\nEx-Soviet agent Whitaker Chambers cited Levin\u00e9 as an inspirational figure, writing \"During the Bavarian Council Republic in 1919, Levin\u00e9 was the organiser of the Workers' and Soldiers' Soviets. When the Bavarian Council Republic was crushed, Levin\u00e9 was captured and court-martialed. The court-martial told him: \"You are under sentence of death.\" Levin\u00e9 answered: 'We Communists are always under sentence of death.'\"",

She ended her speech by saying this:\n\n\"I want to end my speech with a slogan that hangs over my bed in Arabic. It says, 'La tastaw Hishu tareeq el-Haq, min qilit es-sa'ireen fihi' and that translates into, 'Fear not the path of truth for the lack of people walking on it.'

All in all, 30 strikers were killed, 57 were wounded, and property damage exceeded $80 million.\n\nThe Pullman Strike was a watershed moment in American labor history - Eugene V. Debs, who led the strike, was arrested and imprisoned, radicalizing his politics and setting him on the path to become a prominent socialist leader and co-founder of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).\n\nAfter the strike was over, President Cleveland declared the national holiday \"Labor Day\" in an effort to appease organized labor.",

Police Commissioner Sambor infamously ordered the fire department to \"let the fire burn\", destroying 65 nearby homes comprising two city blocks.\n\nAlthough an investigation found that the law enforcement and fire department actions were negligent, no criminal charges were filed.\n\nIn October 2013, a documentary about the stand-off and bombing titled \"Let the Fire Burn\" was released by Zeitgeist Films.",

The murders took place just ten days after the Kent State Massacre.\n\nOn the evening of May 14th, over 100 students had gathered on Lynch Street (named after Reconstruction era legislator John Lynch) and were reportedly pelting rocks at white motorists. Tensions increased when a false rumor spread that Charles Evers, older brother of Medgar Evers and a civil rights activist in his own right, had been killed.\n\nThe police responded in force; at least 75 Jackson police units from the city of Jackson and the Mississippi Highway Patrol attempted to control the crowd, while firemen extinguished fires that had been set. After the firefighters had left the scene, the police moved to disperse the crowd that had gathered in front of Alexander Hall, a women's dormitory.\n\nJust after midnight, the police opened fire on the building. The gunfire lasted for 30 seconds and more than 460 shots were fired. Every window on the narrow side of the building facing Lynch Street was shattered and two people were killed, one a seventeen year old at a nearby high school. Twelve more were wounded.",

In 1963, Gray and tenants brought rats, both dead and alive, from their housing directly to the Manhattan Civil Court. They won.\n\nJesse Gray was born in Junica, outside Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As a worker, he became a leader with the National Maritime Union (NMU). While working as a NMU organizer, his global travels introduced him to many social justice movements, including Scotland's Tenant Movement.\n\nGray settled in New York City in the early 1950s and began to organize local protests with groups such as the Harlem Tenants Council and the Harlem Tenant and Welfare Council. Gray was not deterred from his activism despite being arrested and beaten by police.\n\nIn 1963, Gray led one of the most famous of the tenant strikes in Harlem, New York, in protest of \"sub-human\" living conditions. Beginning in November, thirteen families living in slum housing on 117th street withheld rent.\n\nOn December 30th, 1963, these tenants were expected to appear in Manhattan Civil Court to defend themselves against the landlords who ordered their evictions. With news media looking on, they brought rats, both dead and alive, to the court to demonstrate terrible living conditions that the property owners subjected them to.\n\nThese tenants also presented evidence that the heat, electricity, working plumbing, and rodent extermination were routinely denied to them. Their cases were dismissed and the tenants' plight was prominently broadcast on news media.\n\nIn 1969, Gray decided to quit his work as a tenant activist and pursue elected office as a Democrat. He was elected to the State Assembly in 1972 and was defeated in 1974.",

Before leading the People's State of Bavaria, he worked as a journalist in Marburg, Nuremberg, and Munich. In the early 1890s, Eisner served nine months in prison for writing an article that attacked Kaiser Wilhelm II.\n\nIn 1918, Eisner was convicted of treason for his role in inciting a strike of munitions workers. He spent nine months in Cell 70 of Stadelheim Prison, but was released during the General Amnesty in October of that year.\n\nFollowing his release from prison, Eisner helped organize the revolution that overthrew the Bavarian monarchy, declaring Bavaria to be a free state and republic. Despite Eisner's socialist politics, he explicitly distanced the movement from the Bolsheviks and promised to uphold property rights.\n\nOn February 21st, 1919, while on his way to deliver his resignation to Parliament, Eisner was assassinated in Munich by a far-right German nationalist. Eisner's murder made him a martyr for left-wing causes, and a period of lawlessness in Bavaria followed his death.\n\nOn the night of April 6th-7th, 1919, communists, encouraged by the news of the communist revolution in Hungary, declared a Soviet Republic, with Ernst Toller as chief of state. The Bavarian Soviet Republic was crushed by the right-wing German Freikorps.\n\nSome of the military leaders of the Freikorps, including Rudolf Hess and Franz Ritter von Epp, would go on to become powerful figures in the Nazi Party. Ironically, Adolf Hitler himself marched in the funeral procession for Eisner, a Jew, wearing a red armband as a display of sympathy.\n\n\"Truth is the greatest of all national possessions. A state, a people, a system which suppresses the truth or fears to publish it, deserves to collapse.\"\n\n- Kurt Eisner",

        "description": "Magnus Hirschfeld, born on this day in 1868, was a German physician, sexologist, and feminist whose books were burned by the Nazis. His work was among the earliest advocacy for homosexual and transgender rights in the modern period, according to historian Dustin Goltz.\n\nHirschfeld was born to a Jewish family in Kolberg, Poland on May 14th, 1868. After completing his studies, Hirschfeld lived in the United States for eight months.\n\nWhile in Chicago, Hirschfeld, himself a homosexual, noted a strong similarity between the gay subculture between that city and Berlin, leading him to a theory of universality of homosexuality in the human condition.\n\nHirschfeld became interested in gay rights because many of his gay patients took their own lives. He was struck by the number of his gay patients who had \"Suizidalnarben\" (scars left by suicide attempts), and often found himself trying to give his patients a reason to live.\n\nDuring the Harden-Eulenburg affair of 1906-09, a prominent sex scandal in Imperial Germany, Hirschfeld testified \"homosexuality was part of the plan of nature and creation just like normal love\", causing a national scandal.\n\nHirschfeld developed a system which categorized 64 possible types of sexual intermediary, including those he described under the term \"transvestite\", which he coined in 1910, and those he described under the term \"transsexuals\", a term he coined in 1923. Hirschfeld and the Institute for Sexual Sciences issued a number of transvestite passes to trans people in order to prevent them from being harassed by the police.\n\nHirschfeld co-wrote and acted in the 1919 film \"Anders als die Andern\" (English: \"Different From the Others\"), in which Conrad Veidt played one of the first homosexual characters ever written for cinema. The film had a specific gay rights law reform agenda; after Veidt's character is blackmailed by a male prostitute, he eventually comes out rather than continuing to make the blackmail payments. His career is destroyed and he is driven to suicide.\n\nLess than four months after the Nazis took power in 1933, Hirschfeld's Institute was sacked. On the morning of May 6th, a group of university students who belonged to the National Socialist Student League stormed the institution, shouting \"Burn Hirschfeld!\" and began to beat up its staff and smash up the premises.\n\nThe state seized the Institution's library and held a book burning event four days later. Berlin police arrived at the institution and announced that it was closed forever. Hirschfeld, out of the country at the time, became a political exile and never returned to Germany.\n\nIn 1896, one of Hirschfeld's patients, a young army officer struggling with his homosexuality, killed himself. In his suicide note, the officer stated: \"The thought that you [Hirschfeld] could contribute a future when the German fatherland will think of us in more just terms sweetens the hour of my death.\"",

He was an active anti-war protester, present at the 1968 DNC protests and producing an award winning documentary titled \"Napalm\". He also worked as an investigative journalist for publications such as The Nation and The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nIn December 1971, Charles and his wife Joyce left the U.S. for Latin America, eventually settling down in Santiago, Chile, where he worked as a freelance writer.\n\nOn September 11th, 1973, fascists led by Augusto Pinochet and the CIA ousted democratically elected Marxist President Salvador Allende. In the following weeks, many prominent left-wing activists, such as Flora Sanhueza, Victor Jara, and Frank Teruggi, were arrested and killed.\n\nHorman himself was arrested on September 16th, seized from his home by Chilean soldiers and taken to the National Stadium, which had been turned into a de facto concentration camp following the coup. There, Horman was executed on September 19th (some sources say 18th), 1973.\n\nDocuments declassified by the Clinton administration in 1999 indicate the U.S. knew of Horman's plight but initially obfuscated investigations into his death. They also indicated that it was unlikely Horman would have been killed without the knowledge and permission of the CIA.\n\nIn June 2014, a Chilean court ruled that US authorities had played a \"fundamental\" role in Horman's murder. In January 2015, two former Chilean intelligence officials were sentenced to jail in Chile for the murders of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi, another American activist who was also arrested, executed the following day.",

This was fueled by serious problems of landlessness in the Kikuyu reserves, which were pushing out increasing numbers of ahoi. The land litigation cases that followed, especially in Kiambu, saw the losers becoming either workers in their former lands, now owned by the growing elite of commercial farmers, or simply leaving for Nairobi.\n\nOn the morning of May 15th, Fred Kubai and Makhan Singh, leaders in the East African Trades Union Congress (EATCU), were arrested by and charged with being officers of an unregistered trade union refusing to dissolve within the three month notification period.\n\nLater the same day, members of the EATCU declared a general strike to begin on the 16th, but by evening a general strike was already in effect all over Nairobi.\n\nThe strike paralyzed airport travel, public services, and greatly limited commercial business. Strike leadership called off the action after a week's worth of protest, disseminating a return-to-work order for May 25th.\n\nIn the aftermath of the strike, the power of trade unions was diminished with the government arresting thousands of their members. Despite this setback, the labor movement in Kenya was not broken and continued to gain momentum in the following decade.",

Nakba Day protests take place around the world and have been attacked by Israel.\n\nThe foundational events of the Nakba took place during and shortly after the 1947-1949 Palestine war, including 78% of Mandatory Palestine being declared as Israel, the exodus of 700,000 Palestinians, the depopulation and destruction of over 500 Palestinian villages and subsequent geographical erasure, the denial of the Palestinian right of return, and the creation of permanent, stateless Palestinian refugees.\n\nAlthough May 15th had been used as an unofficial commemoration of the Nakba since 1949, Nakba Day was formalized in 1998 after Yasser Arafat proposed that Palestinians should mark the 50th anniversary of the Nakba during the First Intifada.\n\nThe Nakba was a key event in the development of Palestinian culture and is a foundational symbol of Palestinian identity, along with \"Handala\", a ten-year old cartoon character developed by Naji al-Ali; the keffiyeh, a checkered black and white scarf worn around the head; and the \"symbolic key\" (many Palestinian refugees have kept the keys to the homes they were forced to flee).\n\nOn Nakba Day 2011, Palestinians and other Arabs from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, and Syria marched towards their respective borders, or ceasefire lines and checkpoints in Israeli-occupied territories, to mark the event. At least twelve Palestinians and supporters were killed and hundreds wounded as a result of shootings by the Israeli Army.\n\n\"In resisting the Nakba, the Palestinians have struck at the heart of the Zionist project that insists that the Nakba be seen as a past event.

The agents were acquitted on the basis of self-defense despite the fact that both Hatfield and Chambers were unarmed.",

U.S. forces withdrew in 1924 on condition that the U.S. government could manage subsequent elections in the country.\n\nThe marines arrived with the goal of offering protection to the U.S. Legation and the U.S. Consulate, and to occupy the Fort San Geronimo. Within hours, these two companies were reinforced with seven additional companies.\n\nTwo days later, the President of the Dominican Republic, Juan Isidro Jimenes, resigned. The U.S. took control of the country and began imposing military rule on November 29th, 1916.\n\nA guerrilla movement, known as the \"gavilleros\", with leaders such as General Ram\u00f3n Natera, enjoyed considerable support from the population in the eastern provinces of El Seibo and San Pedro de Macor\u00eds. Having knowledge of the local terrain, they fought against the occupation from 1917 to 1921.\n\nDominican control of the island returned in 1924, when the U.S. government agreed to withdraw on condition of holding elections with American oversight and the acceptance of American officers into the Dominican National Guard.\n\nSoon after, dictator Rafael Trujillo would begin his first eight year reign over the country, waging a brutal and violent suppression of the domestic population and promoting a form of prejudice against Haitians known as \"Antihaitianismo\".",

Its members heckled politicians, held demonstrations and marches, broke the law to force arrests, broke windows in prominent buildings, set fire to post boxes, committed night-time arson of unoccupied houses and churches, and, when imprisoned, went on hunger strike and endured physically traumatizing force-feeding.\n\nGarnett participated in several of these actions as a young adult, chaining herself in 1909, along with four other activists, to a statue in Parliament in protest of a law meant to prohibit disorderly conduct while Parliament was in session.\n\nOn November 14th, 1909, Garnett assaulted Winston Churchill, who instituted policies of force feeding suffragettes in prison, with a whip, striking him several times while shouting \"Take that in the name of the insulted women of England!\"",

He was executed by the state in 1911 during the \"High Treason Incident\".\n\nGud\u014d was ordained as a Soto Zen priest in 1897. In 1904, he became the abbot of Rinsenji temple in a poor area of a rural region of the Hakone Mountains. Village tradition states that every autumn Gud\u014d would invite poor villagers to divide the harvest from the temple's only two trees equally among themselves.\n\nGud\u014d was a self-identified socialist and outspoken advocate for redistributive land reform, overturning the Meiji emperor system, encouraging conscripts to desert en masse, and advancing democratic rights for all. He also criticized Zen leaders who claimed that low social position was justified by karma.\n\nOne of Gud\u014d's most widely read and circulated works was a scathing denunciation of the Imperial Japanese government. Contradicting official state doctrine, he argued that the Emperors of the Imperial family were neither divine nor the destined rulers of Japan, and that their ancestors \"came forth from a corner of Kyushu, killing and robbing people as they did. They then destroyed their fellow thieves.\"\n\nDue to the popularity of Gud\u014d's subversive publications, he was arrested in May 1909 and charged with violating press and publication laws. When police uncovered an alleged socialist plot to assassinate the Emperor (known as the \"High Treason Incident\"), Gud\u014d was accused of being a co-conspirator.\n\nIn 1911, he, along with eleven other socialists, were convicted and executed. In July 1909, before Gud\u014d's conviction, officials of the S\u014dt\u014d Zen sect revoked Gud\u014d'sabbotship.\n\n\"When I began reading the Heimin Shimbun at that time [1904], I realized that its principles were identical with my own and therefore I became an anarcho-socialist.\"\n\n- Uchiyama Gud\u014d",

On May 18th, two hundred students gathered at the gate of Chonnam National University in defiance of its closing, clashing with thirty paratroopers.\n\nThe protest was violently subdued, and the first fatality of the repression was a 29-year old deaf man who had simply been passing by. In response, the population rebelled en masse, with more than 10,000 protesters joining the students over the next few days.\n\nAs the protests grew, so did state repression and an increasingly militant civilian response to it. By May 21st, civilian militias were engaging in full-blown battles with the army. After the civilian militias acquired and began using light machine guns, the army retreated and protesters temporarily gained control of Gwangju.\n\nThe rebellion was sustained until being defeated by force on May 27th. There is no official death toll for the uprising; figures vary from the low hundreds to more than two thousand dead. Regardless, the recorded deaths in the month of May were 2,300 higher than average. Nearly 1,400 were arrested for involvement in the Gwangju incident, and 427 were indicted.\n\nIn May 2020, 40 years after the uprising, the independent \"May 18 Democratization Movement Truth Commission\" was launched to investigate the crackdown and use of military force. Under legislation passed in 2018, it would operate for two years, with a one-year extension allowed if necessary.",

        "description": "Daniel Guerin, born on this day in 1904, was a French libertarian communist and pioneering activist for queer liberation.\n\nBorn to a wealthy liberal Parisian family, Guerin worked as a bookseller in Syria and Lebanon in the late 1920s, where he began to develop leftist sympathies after witnessing the brutalities of French colonialism.\n\nAs a young man, Guerin also traveled across French Indochina, visiting present-day Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. On the journey over, he studied works by socialist theorists, including Marx, Proudhon, and Lenin.\n\nAfter returning to France in 1930, Guerin moved into a working class neighborhood and began writing for and directly involving himself with syndicalist and revolutionary socialist groups. \n\nWhile initially drawn to Lenin and Trotsky, he soon came to reject vanguardism in favor of a more libertarian approach, writing \"I concluded\u2026that socialism must rid itself of the fake notion of the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' in order to rediscover its libertarian authenticity\".\n\nGuerin was also a committed anti-fascist. In his 1936 text \"Fascism and Big Business\", Guerin explores the connections between the fascist regimes in Italy and Germany, and their ties to local capitalist classes.\n\nIn 1940, Guerin was detained by occupying Nazi forces in Oslo. Upon release, he managed to return to France in 1942.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Guerin spent some time residing in the United States, continuing his writing there. He wrote of the American labor movement and the black liberation struggle more broadly.\n\nAlthough Guerin would often directly relate his radicalization to his sexuality, he lived much of his life at a time when the workers' movement, like society at large, tended towards homophobic attitudes.\n\nIn 1955, Guerin wrote a text on the studies of American sexologist Alfred Kinsey where he began to openly argue for change, stating: \"The vicious circle will only be broken when progressive workers adopt both a more scientific and a more humane attitude towards homosexuality\". \n\nFor this stance, Guerin was attacked by many portions of the left, including the Communist Party of France (PCF). In 1965, in rejection of his detractors, Guerin came out, becoming one of the first openly gay communist figures in France.\n\nGuerin's politics continued to evolve, and he would variously describe himself as either an anarchist or a Libertarian Marxist. From 1955, he was a member of the group Nouvelle Gauche, which would go throw a series of mergers before becoming part of the Unified Socialist Party in 1960.\n\nIn 1963, Guerin presented a report on workers' self-management to Ahmed Ben Bella, the first President of Algeria following successful war for independence against France. He later opposed the military junta that overthrew Ben Bella in 1965.\n\nGuerin was an active participant of the May 68 uprising in France. Aside from the event's obvious broader political and revolutionary significance, this period marked an opening for significant changes in social attitudes - including towards homosexuality. On May 68, Guerin wrote \"in contesting class society more broadly, they\u2019re [homosexuals] led to unmask their sexuality against the \u2018hetero-police\u2019 at the same time as they fight for the Revolution\".\n\nAmong Guerin's works are Anarchism: From Theory to Practice, No Gods No Masters: An Anthology of Anarchism, Autobiography of Youth, and Fire in the Blood.\n\nGuerin continued writing and political activity in later years, joining the Union des Travailleurs Communistes Libertaires. He remained a member until his death in 1988.\n\n\"The fact that I am married, a father, a grandfather, bisexual, homosexual, this explosive whole, it seems to me that this is what I must leave behind as the final expression of my life as a writer and as a man.\"\n\n- Daniel Guerin",

        "description": "Malcolm X, born on this day in 1925, was a revolutionary civil rights leader who advocated for black liberation by \"any means necessary\".\n\nBorn Malcolm Little, he spent his youth living in a series of foster homes and engaging in petty crime, eventually serving six years in prison for larceny and breaking and entering.\n\nWhile in prison, Malcolm joined the Nation of Islam (NOI) and adopted the surname \"X\" to acknowledge his unknown African ancestral name. Malcolm quickly became a leader with the NOI and was paroled in 1952, beginning a period of radical advocacy for black liberation.\n\nIn the 1960s, Malcolm X broke with the Nation of Islam, growing disillusioned with its leader Elijah Muhammed. During his 1964 pilgrimage to Mecca, he witnessed Muslims of \"all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans\" treat each other as equals in worship. Because of this, Malcolm X became convinced that Islam could be used as a means to achieve racial equality.\n\nOn February 21st, 1965, Malcolm was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences. Two of these men, Muhammed Abdul Aziz and Khalil Islam, were exonerated in 2021 after a 22-month investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney found that evidence of their innocence, including FBI documents, was withheld at trial.\n\nThe Shabazz family are among those who have accused Louis Farrakhan of involvement in Malcolm X's assassination. In 1994, Betty Shabazz was asked if she thought Farrakhan had anything to do with her late husband's death. She replied \"Of course, yes. Nobody kept it a secret. It was a badge of honor. Everybody talked about it, yes.\"\n\nIn the wake of his assassination, capitalist press vilified Malcolm X, while media in Africa, China, and Cuba lauded him as a hero and a martyr. The New York Times wrote that Malcolm X was \"an extraordinary and twisted man\" who \"turn[ed] many true gifts to evil purpose\", while Time magazine condemned him \"an unashamed demagogue\" whose \"creed was violence.\"\n\nIn contrast, The Ghanaian Times identified Malcolm X as among \"a host of Africans and Americans who were martyred in freedom's cause.\" In China, the People's Daily described him as a martyr killed by \"ruling circles and racists\" whose death illustrated that \"in dealing with imperialist oppressors, violence must be met with violence.\"\n\nIn 2023, The Guardian reported that the Shabazz family announced their plans to sue the FBI, New York Police, and other agencies over Malcom X's death. Ilyasah Shabazz, the third daughter of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz, announced that new information indicates federal and state agencies \u201cconspired to and executed their plan to assassinate\u201d. Ilyasah added \"For years, our family has fought for the truth to come to light concerning his murder and we\u2019d like our father to receive the justice that he deserves.\"\n\n\"Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it.\"\n\n- Malcolm X",

He passed away from an AIDS-related illness at the age of 26.\n\nAshton was born on May 19th, 1960 and grew up in Portrush, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. In 1982, he began volunteering with the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard, supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and joined the Young Communist League, later serving as its general secretary.\n\nIn 1984, with his friend Mike Jackson, Ashton co-founded the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM) support group after the two men collected donations for striking miners at the London Lesbian and Gay Pride march that year.\n\nDiagnosed with HIV/AIDS, Ashton was admitted to Guy's Hospital on January 30th, 1987 and died 12 days later of Pneumocystis pneumonia. His death prompted a significant response from the gay community, in both writing and attendance of his funeral at Lambeth Cemetery.\n\nThe LGSM's activities were dramatized in the 2014 film \"Pride\", however the film completely omitted Ashton's participation in the Communist Party.\n\n\"I had to question the morals and the ideas that society had put there for me to follow. What they wanted me to be was a little straight boy, getting married, settling down, having kids...If that's what they say about sexuality, then what about the rest of life? And I started to see that basically the whole country is not geared for the people. It's geared for the few people who're making money out of it.\"\n\n- Mark Ashton",

When the agents attempted to leave town that evening, they were stopped by Matewan Police Chief Sid Hatfield, who claimed to have arrest warrants from the county sheriff.\n\nThe agents then produced their own warrant for Sid Hatfield's arrest, however the Matewan Mayor Cabell Testerman declared it fake upon inspection. While this discussion was happening, the group was quietly surrounded by armed miners, who were watching while hidden in buildings along the street.\n\nGunfire broke out (it is unknown which group fired first), and ten people were killed in the subsequent fighting. Seven of the agents and the Mayor Cabell were killed. Hatfield, however, survived and was immediately regarded as a hero by the coal miners.\n\nHatfield was later assassinated while standing trial for murder by other Baldwin-Felts agents, who successfully claimed self-defense, despite the fact he was unarmed while gunned down on the courthouse steps.\n\nThe incident inflamed tensions between either side. Six months after Hatfield's assassination, the Battle of Blair Mountain took place when more than 10,000 miners took up arms against the state.",

Haiti was the first country in the region to outlaw slavery.\n\nLouverture's participation in the war was complex, first fighting for the Spanish against the French; then for France against Spain and Great Britain; and finally, he fought on behalf of independence for Saint-Domingue against the French.\n\nInitially, Louverture was only supportive of fighting for better living conditions for the enslaved, but, after committing to the full abolition of slavery in 1791, he issued a proclamation at Camp Turel of St. Domingue: \"Brothers and friends, I am Toussaint Louverture; perhaps my name has made itself known to you. I have undertaken vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality to reign in St Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite yourselves to us, brothers and fight with us for the same cause.\"\n\nAs a revolutionary leader, Louverture's military and political acumen helped transform the fledgling slave rebellion into a revolutionary movement. He governed Saint-Domingue with varying degrees of power for several years, proclaiming an autonomous constitution for the colony in 1801 that declared himself its governor for life.\n\nLouverture was eventually tricked into being arrested by Brunet, a French General, and deported to France, where he died of unknown causes while imprisoned. Shortly thereafter, the colony finally achieved independence under the leadership of Jean-Jacques Dessalines.\n\n\"This gun is liberty; hold for certain that the day when you no more have it, you will be returned to slavery.\"\n\n- Toussaint Louverture",

        "description": "On this day in 1871, the Paris Commune, a hotbed of radical working class politics and watershed moment in revolutionary anti-capitalist history, was crushed by the French National Army. 20,000 people were killed and 44,000 arrested.\n\nThe Paris Commune was a radical socialist government that had formed in Paris a few months earlier, on March 18th, 1871. The Commune developed a set of progressive, secular, and social democratic policies, although its existence was too brief to implement all of them.\n\nAmong these policies were the separation of church and state, abolition of child labor, abolishment of interest on some forms of debt, as well as the right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if it was deserted by its original owner.\n\nThe Commune was attacked by the French National Army on May 21st, 1871, beginning the so-called \"Bloody Week\" which defeated the revolutionary movement. After crushing the rebellion, the French government imprisoned approximately 44,000 people for their role in the uprising. Estimated deaths from the fighting are around 20,000.\n\nThe Paris Commune was analyzed by many communist thinkers, including Karl Marx, who identified it as a dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin danced in the snow when the newly formed Bolshevik government lasted longer than the Paris Commune.\n\nThe episode inspired similar revolutionary attempts around the world, including in Moscow (1905), Petrograd (1917), and Shanghai (1927 and 1967).",

        "description": "On this day in 1979, the \"White Night Riots\" began in San Francisco after Harvey Milk's assassin was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, the most lenient sentence possible. More than 160 people were hospitalized, including 60 cops.\n\nHarvey Milk was one of the first openly gay politicians in the U.S., and had been elected to serve as a city supervisor in San Francisco in 1977. On November 28th, 1978, Milk, along with Mayor George Moscone, were assassinated by former police officer and disgruntled ex-supervisor Dan White.\n\nOn May 21st, 1979, Dan White was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, widely perceived to be the lightest possible sentence for his actions. His lawyers successfully argued that White was depressed, citing how much junk food he consumed. This was pejoratively dubbed the \"Twinkie Defense\".\n\nFollowing the announcement of White's conviction, members of San Francisco's gay community began marching in protest, starting at Castro Street and ending with more than 5,000 arriving at City Hall. Protesters shouted \"Kill Dan White!\" and \"Dump Dianne!\", a reference to then Mayor Dianne Feinstein.\n\nSome protesters began breaking City Hall windows, and the crowd was attacked by officers with night sticks. Protesters began setting police cruisers on fire. As one man ignited a cop car, he shouted to a reporter \"Make sure you put in the paper that I ate too many Twinkies!\" Sixty officers were injured and about two dozen arrests were made.\n\nLater that evening, the police raided the predominantly gay Castro neighborhood, invading the Elephant Walk bar and brutalizing its occupants. Police entered the bar yelling slurs, shattering bar windows, and attacking patrons. Other officers outside indiscriminately attacked gays on the street.\n\nThe following day, Supervisor Harry Britt, who had replaced Milk, refused to apologize for the riot: \"Harvey Milk's people do not have anything to apologize for. Now the society is going to have to deal with us not as nice little fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We're not going to put up with Dan Whites anymore.\"\n\nJust a few months after the White Night Riots, Dianne Feinstein was elected to a full term as San Francisco Mayor with some support from the gay community. One of her first actions in office was to appoint a new Chief of Police who oversaw the hiring of a more diverse police force. By 1980, one in seven new police recruits was queer.\n\n\"If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door.\"\n\n- Harvey Milk",

He was imprisoned in Sicily for opposing Italy's entry into World War I (and was interned in Sicily during the conflict for this reason).\n\nMatteotti spoke openly against Italian Fascism and Benito Mussolini, and for a time was leader of the opposition to the National Fascist Party (NFP). In 1921, he denounced fascist violence in a pamphlet titled \"Inchiesta socialista sulle gesta dei fascisti in Italia\" (\"Socialist enquiry on the deeds of the fascists in Italy\").\n\nOn May 30th, 1924, speaking in the Italian Parliament, he alleged that the Fascists committed fraud in the recently held elections and denounced the violence that they used to gain votes. Eleven days later, he was kidnapped and killed by fascists.\n\nAfter Matteotti's body was discovered, Mussolini took full responsibility for the murder as head of the Fascist party (although whether he gave a direct order for the murder remains uncertain) and dared his critics to prosecute him for the crime.\n\nThis challenge went unaccepted. After the Second World War ended, Italian fascists Amerigo Dumini, Giuseppe Viola, and Amleto Poveromo were sentenced to thirty years in prison for their involvement in Matteotti's murder.\n\n\"Now start composing your oration for my funeral.\"\n\n- Giacomo Matteotti, to his friend after denouncing Mussolini in 1924, eleven days before his death",

Milk unsuccessfully ran for office three times, but finally won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977.\n\nMilk was assassinated after only eleven months in office by Dan White, a disgruntled ex-supervisor and former police officer. During Milk's short time in office, he sponsored a bill banning discrimination in public accommodations, housing, and employment on the basis of sexual orientation.

The strike took place in the context of federal repression of labor movements; a few years earlier, Canada had banned the similar Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).\n\nAccordingly, the striking workers faced violent repression from both the government and the coal operators. After the walk-out continued more than a month, coal operators received permission from the Northwest Mounted Police to hire \"special constables\" - in practice unemployed World War I veterans who were paid $10 a day, plied with free liquor, and armed with brass knuckles and crowbars - to break up the strike.\n\nStriking workers were attacked in their homes, and workers who refused to act as scabs were driven 65-km out of town, beaten, and left there. Strikers responded by forming self-defense militias that deterred constables form attacking them. The labor action was finally broken after the federal government declared the OBU illegal and two strike leaders were beaten, tied to telephone poles, and tarred and feathered in August of that year.\n\nDespite the immediate defeat, the mere threat of militant industrial action allowed coal miners in Alberta to achieve massive gains: the miners' day rate rose from $5.70 to $7.50 between 1919 and 1920 and, even after the strike had collapsed, and the rate remained well above inflation for a few years. These gains were eroded by 1924-25, when salaries were reduced back to the pre-strike levels.",

        "description": "On this day in 2020, a Minneapolis cop murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. Floyd's death became the catalyst for protests around the world; by July, more than 14,000 were arrested in the U.S. alone.\n\nFloyd, a 46-year old black man, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill. The cop, 44-year old white man Derek Chauvin, knelt on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds while he was handcuffed and lying face-down in a street. Floyd was dead before Chauvin's knee left his neck.\n\nThe following day, after videos made by witnesses and security cameras became public, all four officers involed were fired. Floyd's state murder became the catalyst for worldwide Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality, which took place on every continent except Antartica.\n\nThe scope of civil unrest within the U.S. was nearly unprecedented. Author Malik Simba writes: \"the protests have involved more than 26 million Americans in 2,000 cities and towns in every state in the U.S., making [them] the most widespread protests around one issue in the history of the nation. By the end of June alone, one month into the protests, 14,000 people had been arrested.\"\n\nInitially, the local District Attorney's Office only harged Chauvin with third-degree manslaughter, but this charge was later increased to second degree murder, following mass protests. On April 20th, 2021, Chauvin was convicted and sentenced to 22.5 years in prison. The other three officers were also later convicted of violating Floyd's civil rights.\n\nFloyd's murder was witnessed by several people, including children. On the incident, seventeen year old Danella Frazier stated \"When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad, I look at my brother, I look at my cousin and my uncle.\" Her nine year old cousin, also an eyewitness, testified in court: \"I was sad and kind of mad and it felt like [Chauvin's knee] was stopping him from breathing and it was hurting him.\"",

All participants in the conflict were guilty of murdering Jews, even the Bolsheviks; however the Volunteer Army had the largest number of victims.\"\n\nThe number of Jews killed during the period is estimated to be between 35,000 and 50,000. A total of 1,236 violent attacks on Jews had been recorded between 1918 and 1921 in Ukraine.\n\nThe role of Petliura in those pogroms is controversial. While Petliura actively sought to halt anti-Jewish violence on numerous occasions, including the punishment capital punishment for the crime of pogroming, it is also documented that he was afraid to punish officers and soldiers engaged in crimes against Jews for fear of losing their support.\n\nSchwarzbard was a Jewish anarchist living in Paris, becoming acquainted with other anarchist activists who had emigrated from Russia and Ukraine, including figures such as Volin, Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, and Nestor Makhno.\n\nAt the same time, Petliura was living in Paris in exile. On May 25th, 1926, Schwarzbard approached Petliura and asked him in Ukrainian, \"Are you Mr. Petliura?\" Petliura did not answer but raised his cane in response.\n\nSchwartzbard pulled out a gun, shooting him seven times. At the trial, survivors of the pogroms testified that they were brutalized by soldiers who claimed to be acting on orders from Petliura. After eight days, Schwarzbard was acquitted.",

The committee became permanent in 1948 and was terminated in 1975.\n\nThe HUAC is notable for causing de facto media censorship among artists suspected of having communist sympathies. Their investigations resulted in a Hollywood blacklist of over 300 actors, directors, and others.\n\nArists whose careers were damaged by the committee included Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, Alan Lomax, Paul Robeson, Aaron Copland, and Yip Harburg. When one Senator asked Robeson why he didn't remain in the Soviet Union, he replied \"Because my father was a slave and my people died to build this country, and I am going to stay here and have a part of it just like you. And no Fascist-minded people will drive me from it. Is that clear?\"\n\nIn 1960, William Mandel, an expert on Soviet affairs who had lost his position as a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution due to anti-communist repression, was called to testify in front of the HUAC. When asked \"Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?\", Mandel responded:\n\n\"Honorable beaters of children, sadists, uniformed and in plain clothes, distinguished Dixiecrat wearing the clothing of a gentleman, eminent Republican who opposes an accommodation with the one country with which we must live at peace in order for us and all our children to survive...\n\nIf you think that I am going to cooperate with this collection of Judases, of men who sit there in violation of the United States Constitution, if you think I will cooperate with you in any way, you are insane!\"",

Lyun was assassinated in 1947 by a right-wing nationalist refugee from the north. He is also known by the name Yo Un-hyung or the pen-name \"Mongyang\".\n\nLyuh was born in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, the son of a local yangban magnate. In 1910, Lyuh parted from Korean tradition by freeing his household's slaves, giving them enough land and money to become self-sufficient.\n\nLike many in the Korean independence movement, Lyuh sought aid from both right and left. In 1920, he joined the Kory\u01d2 Communist Party, later meeting Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin. In 1924, he also joined Sun Yat-sen's Chinese Nationalist Party to facilitate Sino-Korean cooperation.\n\nIn September 1945, Lyuh proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Korea and became its vice-premier. When the United States occupied the Korean Peninsula, it did not recognize the People's Republic of Korea, and in October he was forced to step down under pressure from the U.S. military government.\n\nIn 1946, Lyuh represented the center-left politically as part of an effort to unify right and left-wing independence struggles, however this strategy earned ire from both sides. On July 19th, 1947, Lyuh was assassinated in Seoul by a 19-year-old North Korean refugee who was an active member of a nationalist right-wing organization.\n\nHis pen-name was Mongyang, the Hanja for \"dream\" and \"the sun\".

She was also the first American woman to own, edit, and operate a newspaper for women.\n\nEven though Amelia did not create the \"bloomers\" clothing style, a comfortable alternative to the heavy, constricting dresses women were expected to wear, her name became associated with the style because of her early and strong advocacy for them.\n\nBy publishing the magazine the \"Lily\", Bloomer became the first woman to own, operate and edit a newspaper for women. The scholarly journal American Journalism described the magazine like this: \"The issues addressed in the Lily\u2014marital relations, political representation, property ownership, education and work opportunities, fair wages, fashion customs, women\u2019s health, religion, and gendered social norms\u2014reflected a broad-based agenda for feminism that is familiar today. At the same time, the journal\u2019s privileging of middle-class white womanhood exposed fissures and blind spots related to race and class that would reverberate for generations.\"\n\nAs an early advocate of women's rights, Bloomer was also responsible for introducing Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to each other.\n\n\"It will not do to say that it is out of woman's sphere to assist in making laws, for if that were so, then it should be also out of her sphere to submit to them.\"\n\n- Amelia Bloomer",

In June, the protests became national in scope and transcended any particular demographic or political ideology. Among the wide range of concerns brought by protesters were issues of freedom of the press, expression, and assembly, as well as the alleged political Islamist government's erosion of Turkey's secularism.\n\nMillions of Turkish football fans, normally divided by intense sports rivalry, marched in unity against the government. Protesters displayed symbols the environmentalist movement, rainbow banners, depictions of Che Guevara, different trade unions, and the PKK and its leader Abdullah \u00d6calan.\n\nOn June 4th, Taksim Dayan\u0131\u015fmas\u0131 (Taksim Solidarity) issued a set of demands that included the preservation of Gezi Park, an end to police violence, the right to freedom of assembly, and an end to the privatization of public spaces. Deputy Prime Minister B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7 met the group on June 5th and rejected these demands.\n\nErdo\u011fan blamed the protests on \"internal traitors and external collaborators\", demonizing his political opposition as the former.

After the Supreme Court sided with the government, Debs was sentenced to prison and the ARU dissolved.\n\nIn re Debs contributed to a widely held belief that the Supreme Court was simply a tool of the wealthy and big business - for the next 40 years business interests hostile to labor unions found the courts willing partners in suppressing strikes through injunction.

Here is a short excerpt of the speech, from Marius Robinson's transcription:\n\n\"I want to say a few words about this matter. I am a woman's rights. [sic] I have as much muscle as any man, and can do as much work as any man. I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped and mowed, and can any man do more than that? I have heard much about the sexes being equal. I can carry as much as any man, and can eat as much too, if I can get it. I am as strong as any man that is now.\n\nAs for intellect, all I can say is, if a woman have a pint, and a man a quart - why can't she have her little pint full? You need not be afraid to give us our rights for fear we will take too much, - for we can't take more than our pint'll hold.\"",

Ongan\u00eda's government had suspended the right to strike, froze workers' wages, suppressed communist movements, and extended the age of retirement.\n\nIn the wake of widespread violent state repression against protesters, the labor union \"CGT de los Argentinos\", led by Agust\u00edn Tosco, called for national strike on May 30th, 1969. In Cordoba, the general strike and protests began one day earlier.\n\nOn the first day of the protests, police opened fire on thousands of protesters, killing a worker named Maximo Mena, causing the strike to escalate into a citywide revolt, leading to widespread destruction of property and seizing of city spaces. Ongan\u00eda crushed the rebellion with the military, and Agust\u00edn Tosco was arrested for his role in the rebellion.",

        "description": "Louise Michel, born on this day in 1830, was a French anarchist, feminist, educator, author, and militant leader of the Paris Commune.\n\nBorn in 1830 as an illegitimate daughter and raised by her grandparents, Louise Michel worked as a schoolteacher before revolution came to Paris, and, in 1865, opened a school dedicated to methods of progressive education.\n\nThere, Michel came into contact with radical thinkers such as Jules Vall\u00e8s and Auguste Blanqui, and was concerned about the impoverishment of those on the margins of French society. In 1869, she was one of the founding members of the \"Society for the Demand of Civil Rights for Women\", focused on improving girls' education.\n\nIn 1870, war broke out between France and the Empire of Prussia. The war quickly ended in defeat for France, and, the following March, discontented members of the National Guard mutinied against the new national government in Paris, marking the beginning of the working class uprising known as the Paris Commune.\n\nMichel joined the rebellion and was elected head of the Montmartre Women's Vigilance Committee, playing an important role in the provisional revolutionary administration. She had a romantic relationship with Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9, a senior member of the Commune's Committee of Public Safety.\n\nMichel personally fought on the front lines at the barricades, also organizing ambulance stations to transport the wounded. She expressed a willingness to sacrifice herself for the sake of revolution, stating \"I like the smell of gunpowder, grapeshot flying through the air, but above all, I'm devoted to the Revolution.\"\n\nMichel survived the fall of the Commune and was brought to trial in December 1871. She dared the judges to sentence her to death, saying \"It seems that every heart that beats for freedom has no other right than a bit of lead, so I claim mine!\"\n\nUnlike Ferr\u00e9, who was executed, she was instead punished by deportation to a penal settlement in the French colony of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn New Caledonia, she became acquainted with the indigenous Kanak people, and took an interest in their culture and language, later supporting them during an 1878 revolt against French rule.\n\nMichel also befriended Nathalie Lemel, another exiled figure from the Commune, and became an explicit anarchist under her influence. In 1880, amnesty was granted to former Communards, and Michel returned to Paris, where she was greeted as a hero by the downtrodden of the city and resumed her revolutionary activity.\n\nMichel later moved to London for five years, where she ran a school for children of political refugees, and became a famed speaker across Europe, meeting figures such as the Pankhurst sisters, Peter Kropotkin, and Emma Goldman.\n\nIn 1904, Michel embarked on an anti-colonial speaking tour in French Algeria, before falling ill shortly after. She died in Marseille on January 9th, 1905 at the age of 74. Her funeral was attended by over 100,000 people, receiving delegations from socialist and anarchist groups all across Europe.\n\nToday, Michel remains one of the most famous icons of the Paris Commune and is regarded as a pioneer of anarcha-feminism.",

While there, Bishop acquired a law degree and studied the works of Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Julius Nyerere.\n\nIn 1970, Bishop returned to Grenada and was active politically, representing striking nurses in court and leading the New Jewel Movement (NJM), a Marxist-Leninist vanguard party. In 1979, the NJM successfully led a coup against Eric Gairy and made Bishop the Prime Minister of Grenada.\n\nAmong Bishop's core principles were workers' rights, women's rights, and the struggle against racism and apartheid. Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave. Sex discrimination was made illegal. Organizations for education, health care, youth affairs, and literacy were also established. Due to his government's efforts, illiteracy and unemployment greatly declined.\n\nIn 1983, disputes within the party culminated in Bishop, along with seven members of his cabinet, being captured and executed. After his assassination, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and Grenada's governor-general Paul Scoon appealed to the United States to resolve the political situation. Within a few weeks, U.S. President Ronald Reagan launched an invasion of Grenada.",

The police fired on and beat the crowd, including many women and children.\n\nAccording to Dorothy Day, a Catholic labor activist who was present that day, \"50 people were shot, of whom 10 later died; 100 others were beaten with clubs.\" A Coroner's Jury declared the killings to be \"justifiable homicide\".\n\nMany in the press called it a labor riot or \"red riot\". In the wake of the massacre, film footage of the event was suppressed for fear of creating, in the words of an official at Paramount News agency, \"mass hysteria.\"\n\nAt the time, the Daily Boston Globe reported that this footage was banned from being shown in Chicago by the city's Police Department. The footage of this worker massacre have been preserved by the Illinois Labor Society and is publicly available today.",

As economic crises in the late 1820s worsened living conditions, the people of Merthyr began to agitate for political change.\n\nReform-minded ironmaster William Crawshay co-founded the \"Political Union of Merthyr\" in 1830 to fight for \"democratic and humanitarian reforms\", such as universal suffrage and parliamentary reform. Crawshay also tried to keep his worker's wages high and produce a higher amount of iron than what the market demanded to expand his workforce.\n\nIn the midst of an enduring economic crisis, Crawshay began cutting wages in March 1831. In response, workers abandoned the reformist Political Union and protesting en masse. In Merthyr, huge crowds burned effigies of prominent Tories in the streets, called for opponents of Reform to be hanged, and known Tories found their windows smashed and their businesses looted.\n\nOn May 23rd, dozens of miners and \"puddlers\" (those known for participating in political agitation) received new, deeper wage cuts, and 84 were dismissed altogether.\n\nA week later, on May 30th, 1831, workers assembled at Waum Common, where they made speeches, carried banners and formulated demands, marking the beginning of the Rising. Despite the spontaneous and leaderless character of the protests, a four-point program emerged: abolition of the Court of Requests, the abolition of debt imprisonment, new laws against price gouging, and no hiring of new miners on lower wages than their predecessors.\n\nThe following day, workers reclaimed goods that had been seized by debtors. Protestors marched to the mines, where they convinced those still working to join the resistance. A general strike broke out, and workers effectively seized control of Merthyr Tydfil, a key engine of British industrial production.\n\nWith Crawshay's help, the army was soon dispatched in order to restore state control, but, finding themselves outnumbered by an armed citizenry, soldiers were forced to fall back. Rebels defeated successive military units before the rebellion was finally put down on April 7th.",

Bakunin's prestige as an activist also made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, gaining substantial influence among radicals throughout the continent.\n\nBakunin is also notable as a vehement opponent of Marxism, especially of the dictatorship of the proletariat, predicting that Marxist governments would become one-party dictatorships over the proletariat, not by the proletariat. On this matter, he stated \"Either one destroys the State or one must accept the vilest and most fearful lie of our century: the red bureaucracy.\"\n\nBakunin also espoused anti-Semitic views in some of his works, writing \"...and where there is centralization of the state, there must necessarily be a central bank, and where such a bank exists, the parasitic Jewish nation, speculating with the labor of the people, will be found.\"\n\nBakunin biographer Mark Leier wrote that \"Bakunin had a significant influence on later thinkers, ranging from Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta to the Wobblies and Spanish anarchists in the Civil War to Herbert Marcuse, E.P. Thompson, Neil Postman, and A.S. Neill, down to the anarchists gathered these days under the banner of 'anti-globalization.'\"\n\n\"Freedom without socialism is privilege and injustice, and socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality.\"\n\n- Mikhail Bakunin",

He was met with violent resistance, which rapidly spread across the southeast of the country.\n\nInspired by the sermons of the radical cleric John Ball, an army of rebels led by Wat Tyler marched on London. There, they were joined by many locals, and together they attacked gaols, executed government officials, and destroyed government property.\n\nOn June 14th, King Richard II met with the rebels, submitting to most of their demands, including the abolition of serfdom. The following day, however, he took back these concessions and killed Wat Tyler.\n\nUnrest continued for weeks afterward, but the rebels were crushed by state forces. Most of the rebel leaders were tracked down and executed. By November, at least 1,500 rebels had been killed. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years' War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France.",

Historians disagree as to whether such a plot existed and, if there was one, its scale.\n\nDespite the lack of hard evidence for such a conspiracy, affluent whites in New York City were hysterical with paranoia over poor whites and the enslaved collaborating to burn the city down. During a series of court cases brought against alleged members of this conspiracy, the prosecution repeatedly changed the grounds of accusation and ignored the alibis proffered by slaveowners for their slaves' non-involvement.\n\nAt its height, over half of the city's enslaved males over the age of 16 were implicated in the plot and jailed. On this day in 1741, the first two victims, two men named Kofi and Quaco, were hanged.\n\nAfter the hysteria ended, eighteen enslaved people were hanged, thirteen burned alive, four whites were executed, and dozens of people had been deported out of the city.",

        "description": "On this day in 1906, revolutionary anarchist Mateu Morral attempted to assassinate Spanish King Alfonso XIII and his bride via bomb. The attack failed, killing 24 bystanders, and caused state persecution of other anarchists.\n\nMateu Morral was a young, wealthy anarchist who had recently worked at Escuela Moderna, an anarchist school in Barcelona, Spain, founded and ran by Francisco Ferrer. In the weeks leading up to the attack, Mateu took a leave of absence from the school, citing illness.\n\nOn May 31st, 1906, Mateu Morral threw a bomb, obscured in a bouquet of flowers, from a hotel balcony at King Alfonso XIII's car as he returned with his bridge Victoria Eugenie from their wedding in Madrid. While the King and Queen were unscathed, 24 bystanders and soldiers were killed, and over 100 more wounded.\n\nMorral fled the scene and sought refuge from Republican (although explicitly anti-anarchist) journalist Jos\u00e9 Nakens. Nakens reluctantly gave Morral shelter, but Mateu grew mistrustful the same night and fled. A few days later, he was discovered at a Madrid railway station and killed a police officer and himself rather than be taken into custody.\n\nAuthorities used the 1906 regicide attempt as a pretext to suppress Ferrer and his educational work. Ferrer was arrested within a week of the attack and charged with both its organization and recruiting of Morral. He was imprisoned for a year while prosecutors pursued evidence for his trial, and was ultimately acquitted.\n\nModern historians disagree to the extent of Ferrer's involvement. Historian of anarchism Paul Avrich has stated \"Barring the discovery of conclusive evidence, Ferrer's role in the Morral affair must remain an open question.\"\n\nFerrer was executed by the Spanish government three years later, after a farcical trial convicted him of orchestrating a period of insurrection known as Barcelona's \"Tragic Week\".",

        "description": "On this day in 1921, the Tulsa Race Massacre began when mobs of white people attacked residents and businesses of the Greenwood District, known as \"Black Wall Street\", killing hundreds and rendering 10,000 black families homeless.\n\nHistorian Scott Ellsworth called it \"the single worst incident of racial violence in American history\", with estimates ranging from 75-300 people killed, 800 wounded, and 10,000 black families made homeless from the destruction of property.\n\nThe massacre began over Memorial Day weekend after 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner, was accused of assaulting Sarah Page, the 17-year-old white elevator operator of the nearby Drexel Building. When a lynch mob formed at the jail, an armed group of black men showed up to counter it.\n\nShots rang out when a white person tried to disarm one of the black men. The initial violence left ten people dead, and a mob of enraged white people stormed black neighborhoods, indiscriminately killing families, setting fires, and destroying property.\n\nAs crews from the Tulsa Fire Department arrived to put out fires, they were turned away at gunpoint. One account stated \"It would mean a fireman's life to turn a stream of water on one of those negro buildings. They shot at us all morning when we were trying to do something but none of my men was hit. There is not a chance in the world to get through that mob into the negro district.\"\n\nSeveral eyewitnesses described airplanes carrying white assailants, who fired rifles and dropped firebombs on buildings, homes, and fleeing families. The privately owned aircraft had been dispatched from the nearby Curtiss-Southwest Field outside Tulsa. Law enforcement officials later claimed that the planes were to provide reconnaissance and protect against a \"Negro uprising\".\n\nMultiple eyewitness accounts said that on the morning of June 1st, at least a dozen planes circled the neighborhood and dropped \"burning turpentine balls\" on an office, a hotel, a filling station, and other buildings.\n\nFor 75 years (until 1996), the massacre was almost totally omitted from local, state, and national histories. It was not recognized in the Tulsa Tribune feature of \"Fifteen Years Ago Today\" or \"Twenty-Five Years Ago Today\". A 2017 report detailing the history of the Tulsa Fire Department from 1897 until the date of publication made no mention of the 1921 mass arson.\n\nIn 2015, a previously unknown written eyewitness account of the Tulsa Race Massacre from attorney Buck Colbert Franklin was discovered. Franklin wrote: \"The sidewalks were literally covered with burning turpentine balls. I knew all too well where they came from, and I knew all too well why every burning building first caught fire from the top...I paused and waited for an opportune time to escape. 'Where oh where is our splendid fire department with its half dozen stations?' I asked myself, 'Is the city in conspiracy with the mob?'\"",

According to author Kumarathasan Rasingam, the Library also served as a cultural hub for the Tamil community.\n\nIn 1998, under president Chandrika Kumaratunga, the government began the process to rebuild the Jaffna Public Library with contributions from Sri Lankans and foreign governments, and it was re-opened to the public several years later.",

        "description": "On this day in 1906, Mexican employees of the US-owned Cananea Copper Company went on strike, demanding an end to pay discrimination and an eight-hour day. The strike's repression was a key precursor to the Mexican Revolution of 1910.\n\nThe Cananea Consolidated Copper Company (CCCC) was owned by American Colonel William Greene, whose capitalist enterprise was greatly aided by the corrupt Mexican government of Porfirio D\u00edaz. CCCC employed both American and Mexican workers, however senior positions could only be held by Americans and Mexicans were paid 3.5 pesos a day to the Americans' 5.\n\nCananea was a company town in which workers were forced to live in company housing and buy necessities at the company store. Despite this, the wages offered to Mexican workers were among the highest in the region, making the jobs competitive.\n\nOn June 1st, 1906, nearly all of the Mexican employees of CCCC went on strike. Among their demands were an end to pay discrimination, an eight hour day (down from ten), and a guaranteed representation of Mexicans in the workforce. One slogan was \"Ocho horas! cinco pesos!\" (eight hours, five pesos).\n\nThe company flatly rejected all of the workers' demands, and thousands of laborers began to march in protest. Upon arriving at the company's lumber yard, protesters were hosed down by armed management. Violence broke out, and three workers and both managers were killed, the latter stabbed to death with mining implements. Workers then set fire to the lumber yard, causing ~$100,000 in damages.\n\nThe strike devolved into a de facto war after deputized company men fired on workers approaching the local bank, jail, and company store. The crowd, mostly unarmed, raided local pawnshops for weapons and proceeded to engage in firefights with a combined force of Mexican Federal Troops, 275 volunteers from Arizona, and CCCC forces.\n\nEstimates of casualties vary, but at least 23 were killed and more than 50 were arrested before the workers were defeated. Green blamed the uprising on \"a Socialistic organization that has been formed by malcontents opposed to the D\u00edaz government.\"; literature of the pro-labor Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM) was found in the workers' settlements.\n\nThe Cananea Riot became linked with the R\u00edo Blanco Strike of January 1907 as symbols of D\u00edaz's corruption and subservience to foreign capital. According to historian Leslie Bethell, both became \"household words for hundreds of thousands of Mexicans\". D\u00edaz would be forced to resign in 1911.\n\nThe mine in Cananea currently continues to be worked for copper and was subject to a miners' strike as recently as 2008.",

Hayford established a vocational school for young girls in Sierra Leone that emphasized racial and cultural pride.\n\nHayford was born into an elite Sierra Leone family in Freetown, British Sierra Leone. She spent much of her youth in England and studying throughout the West, also studying music in Germany at the age of 17.\n\nWhile in England, Adelaide married West African author and Pan-Africanist J. E. Casely Hayford (also known as Ekra-Agiman). Their marriage may have influenced her transformation into a cultural nationalist.\n\nIn May 1914, Hayford returned to Sierra Leone, dedicating the rest of her life to educating African girls. In October 1923, she established the Girls' Vocational School, one of the first educational institutions in Sierra Leone to provide young girls with an African-centered education, according to historian Keisha N. Blain.\n\nHayford frequently traveled throughout the world, giving a speaking tour in the United States on misconceptions about Africa. Author Brittany Rogers notes that these travels also exposed her to the exploitation of black female labor throughout the world.\n\nAlthough her educational concept for young girls had a Victorian-influenced, middle class domesticity in mind, Rogers writes that these travels led Hayford to begin writing and speaking on matters of labor as well. Hayford died in her hometown of Freetown, Sierra Leone in 1960.\n\n\"Instantly my eyes were opened to the fact that the education meted out to [African people] had...taught us to despise ourselves. Our immediate need was an education which would instill into us a love of country, a pride of race, an enthusiasm for the black man's capabilities, and a genuine admiration for Africa's wonderful art work.\"",

In this last work, Smiley and West provide a broad, multi-racial look at the history and experience of poverty in the United States, concluding with a twelve-point program to address this poverty.\n\nWest has served as honorary chair of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which he has described as \"the first multiracial, socialist organization close enough to my politics that I could join\". He has also described himself as a \"radical democrat, suspicious of all forms of authority\" in the Matrix-themed documentary \"The Burly Man Chronicles\".\n\nWest was arrested on October 13th, 2014, while protesting against the shooting of Michael Brown and participating in \"Ferguson October\", and again on August 10th, 2015, while demonstrating outside a courthouse in St. Louis on the one-year anniversary of Brown's death.\n\n\"To be an intellectual really means to speak a truth that allows suffering to speak. That is, it creates a vision of the world that puts into the limelight the social misery that is usually hidden or concealed by the dominant viewpoints of a society. 'Intellectual' in that sense simply means those who are willing to reflect critically upon themselves as well as upon the larger society and to ascertain whether there is some possibility of amelioration and betterment.\"\n\n- Cornel West",

The internet in Sudan was blacked out for days following the massacre.\n\nThe sit-in took place in the context of the Sudanese revolution, beginning with mass anti-government protests in December 2018. On April 11th, the military removed President Omar al-Bashir from power in a coup d'\u00e9tat, creating a Transitional Military Council (TMC). Protesters supported by the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) and various democratic opposition groups engaged in street demonstrations, demanding the TMC turn over power to a civilian-led transitional government.\n\nIn the days following the massacre, anti-TMC protests became even more intense, and a general strike involving 60-100% of workers broke out across the country. Roads were blocked and almost all formal and informal businesses were closed, including banks, public transport and Khartoum International Airport.",

        "description": "On this day in 1943, the Zoot Suit Riots began when thousands of white American servicemen in California began indiscriminately attacking people (mostly Latinos) wearing Zoot Suits, which were seen as unpatriotic. The suits were ostensibly seen as unpatriotic due to wartime rations, although they were also racialized, with L.A. Councilman Norris Nelson stating \"the zoot suit has become a badge of hoodlumism\".\n\nThe riots began on the night of June 3rd when ~12 sailors and a group of young Mexicans in zoot suits began fighting. The LAPD responded to the incident \"seeking to clean up Main Street from what they viewed as the loathsome influence of pachuco gangs\", according to historian Luis Alvarez. The police arrested the sailors and not the Mexicans.\n\nThe next day, 200 sailors headed for East Los Angeles, a Mexican-American part of town, and attacked and stripped everyone they came across who were wearing zoot suits. Local press heralded the violence as cleaning up the town, and soon thousands of sailors joined the riot. Journalist Carey McWilliams described what happened like this:\n\n\"Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theaters, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans, and some Filipinos and Negroes, were jerked from their seats, pushed into the streets and beaten with a sadistic frenzy.\"\n\nThe L.A. City Council approved a resolution criminalizing zoot suits, although the ordinance was not signed into law. The Navy and Marine Corps Staff prohibited sailors from traveling to L.A. in an effort to curb the violence, however they officially maintained that the men were acting in self-defense.",

The following day, thousands of protesters surrounded the police station and gave speeches, leading to the formation of the SYM.\n\nAccording to historian Benjamin Bland, \"the SYM would go on to be crucial, both in defending Southall's Asian population against the threat of racism and in helping to inspire the foundation of other Asian youth organisations across the UK\".\n\nThe SYM was also an explicitly anti-fascist organization, clashing with the fascist National Front (NF). After the murder of Chaggar, John Kingsley Read, a former chairman of the NF, stated \"one down, a million to go\".\n\nThese tensions came to a climax when the NF attempted to hold a rally in Southall in 1979, leading to Blair Peach, a socialist schoolteacher, being killed by injuries sustained from police.",

In 1905, Levin\u00e9 returned to Russia to participate in the failed revolution of 1905 against the Tsar and was arrested and exiled to Siberia.\n\nAfter World War I ended, Levin\u00e9 joined the Communist Party of Germany and helped to create a socialist republic in Bavaria. Levin\u00e9 eventually rose to power as the communists assumed control of the government.\n\nHe attempted to pass many reforms, such as giving the more luxurious flats to the homeless and giving workers control and ownership of factories. Levin\u00e9 also planned reforms for the education system and to abolish paper money, but did not get the chance to complete either.\n\nThe German Army, assisted by the right-wing Freikorps paramilitary invaded and quickly conquered Munich on May 3rd, 1919. Levin\u00e9 himself was arrested and shot by firing squad in Stadelheim Prison.\n\nEx-Soviet agent Whitaker Chambers cited Levin\u00e9 as an inspirational figure, writing \"During the Bavarian Council Republic in 1919, Levin\u00e9 was the organiser of the Workers' and Soldiers' Soviets. When the Bavarian Council Republic was crushed, Levin\u00e9 was captured and court-martialed.

He joined the British Army at age 14 to escape poverty and developed a hatred for the institution from firsthand experience. He deserted when his regiment was set to deploy to India.\n\nHe was also member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and founder of the Irish Socialist Republican Party. With labor radical James Larkin, he was centrally involved in the Dublin lock-out of 1913, after which the two men formed the Irish Citizen Army (ICA) the same year.\n\nConnolly was opposed to British rule in Ireland and played a leading role in the Easter Rising of 1916, signing the \"Proclamation of the Irish Republic\" and serving as Commandant of the Dublin Brigade, the regiment that played the most substantial role in the Rising. Connolly was executed by firing squad following the Rising's defeat.\n\n\"If you remove the English army tomorrow and hoist the green flag over Dublin Castle, unless you set about the organization of the Socialist Republic your efforts would be in vain.

A wave of successful strikes followed, standardizing the 10 hour day.\n\nThe strike involved around 20,000 workers, demanding a ten-hour workday and increased wages. The strike ended in complete victory for the workers.\n\nInfluenced by labor agitation in Boston, the Philadelphia General Strike began with unskilled Irish workers on the Schuylkill River coal wharves going out on strike for a ten-hour day. The dock workers patrolled the picket line with swords, threatening any scab who attempted to unload coal from the 75 vessels waiting in the water.\n\nThe coal heavers were soon joined by workers from many other trades, including leather dressers, printers, carpenters, bricklayers, masons, house painters, bakers, and city employees.\n\nOn June 6th, a mass meeting of workers, lawyers, doctors, and a few businessmen, was held in the State House courtyard. The meeting unanimously adopted a set of resolutions giving full support to the workers' demand for wage increases and a shorter workday, as well as increased wages for women workers and a boycott of any coal merchant who worked his men more than ten hours.\n\nThe strike quickly came to a close after city public works employees joined the labor action. The Philadelphia city government announced that the \"hours of labor of the working men employed under the authority of the city corporation would be from 'six to six' during the summers season, allowing one hour for breakfast, and one for dinner.\"\n\nOn June 22nd, three weeks after the coal heavers initially struck, the ten-hour system and an increase in wages for piece-workers was adopted in the city. A wave of successful strikes across the United States followed this victory. By the end of 1835, the ten-hour day had become the standard for most day city laborers.",

Some courts called them \"conspiracies to restrain trade\", and therefore illegal.\n\nIn 1836, twenty-five members of the Union Society of Journeymen Tailors were found guilty of \"conspiracy to injure trade, riot, assault, and battery\" in the state of New York. On June 6th, 27,000 people gathered in City Hall Park to protest the court decision.\n\nA radical pamphlet circulated, titled \"The Rich Against the Poor\", denouncing the judge who issued the decision as a \"tool of aristocracy\". The protesters established a \"Committee of Correspondence\" that comprised of people working in trades, which went on to found the working class Equal Rights party.",

        "description": "On this day in 1967, the Israeli Army occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip, claiming emergency powers with a military decree that greatly restricts the rights of the occupied. The ongoing occupation is the longest in the modern era.\n\nThe Israeli Army action took place in the context of the Six Day War, fought between Israel and a coalition of Arab states. The status of the West Bank as a militarily occupied territory has been affirmed by the International Court of Justice and, with the exception of East Jerusalem, by the Israeli Supreme Court.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch (HRW), the military proclamation issued by the Israeli Army on June 7th, 1967 permitted the application of the Defense (Emergency) Regulations of 1945.\n\nThese regulations empowered, and continue to empower, authorities to declare as an \"unlawful association\" groups that advocate for \"bringing into hatred or contempt, or the exciting of disaffection against\" the authorities, and criminalize membership in or possession of material belonging to or affiliated, even indirectly, with these groups.\n\nHRW goes on to state that these and other broad restrictions on the occupied population violate international law: \"The Israeli army has for over 50 years used broadly worded military orders to arrest Palestinian journalists, activists and others for their speech and activities - much of it non-violent - protesting, criticizing or opposing Israeli policies. These orders are written so broadly that they violate the obligation of states under international human rights law to clearly spell out conduct that could result in criminal sanction.\"\n\nFollowing the military occupation of the West Bank, Israel began expropriating the land and facilitating Israeli settlements in the area, broadly considered a violation of international law. While Israelis in the West Bank are subject to Israeli law and given representation in the Israeli Knesset, Palestinian civilians, mostly confined to scattered enclaves, are subject to martial law and are not permitted to vote in Israel's national elections.\n\nThis two-tiered system has inspired comparisons to apartheid, likening the dense disconnected pockets that Palestinians are relegated to with the segregated Bantustans that previously existed in South Africa when the country was still under white supremacist rule.",

Even teenage boys sweeping the floors were paid more than the women working there.\n\nIn response to this, all 187 women went on strike on June 7th, demanding equal pay for equal work. Despite their labor being classified as unskilled, car production halted within a week. The factory was forced to come to a complete standstill, eventually costing the company over $8 million. Despite this, Ford refused to negotiate.\n\nThe strike ended after Barbara Castle, the Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity, intervened, beginning a set of negotiations at which men were not allowed. The strike ended with an immediate increase of their rate of pay to 8% below that of men, rising to the full Category B rate the following year. In 1984, following an additional strike, the women were categorized as Category C.\n\nThe labor action is considered key to the passing of the Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibited inequality of treatment between men and women in Britain in terms of pay and conditions of employment. In 1978, despite its passage, women's relative position in the UK was still worse than in Italy, France, Germany, or the Benelux countries in 1972.",

The battle took place in the context of drastic pay cuts during the Great Depression.\n\nHistorian Knut D\u00f8rum has written that Norway's biggest industrial disputes ever took place that year, beginning with a six month lock-out in the iron industry, involving up to 86,000 workers and causing a loss of 13 million working days.\n\nAt Menstad, Norsk Hydro and Union & Co hired strike-breakers to replace the striking workers. The workers responded by chasing away the strike-breakers in the days before the battle. The strikers returned on June 8th with police protection that was quickly overwhelmed by protesting workers. In response to the violence, the government deployed troops and ships from to the area.\n\nAfterward, 28 strikers were arrested and put on trial, 20 of whom were sentenced to prison. Most of those arrested were members of the Norwegian Communist Party and the Norwegian Labour Party. Worker organization did not prevent mass unemployment during the Great Depression; in the winter of 1932\u20131933, up to 40% of the trade unionists were unemployed.",

Van der Veen helped forge more than 80,000 ethnic identity papers.\n\nDutch historian Robert-Jan van Pelt has written the following about van der Veen:\n\n\"In 1940, after the German occupation, van der Veen was one of the few who refused to sign the so-called \"Arierverklaring\", the Declaration of Aryan Ancestry. In the years that followed, he tried to help Jews both in practical and symbolic ways.\n\nTogether with the musician Jan van Gilse and the (openly homosexual) artist, art historian, and critic Willem Arondeus, van der Veen established the underground organization De Vrije Kunstenaar (The Free Artist).\n\nVan der Veen and the other artists published a newsletter calling for resistance against the occupation. When the Germans introduced identity documents (Persoonsbewijzen) that distinguished between Jews and non-Jews, van der Veen, Arondeus and the printer Frans Duwaer produced some 80,000 false identity papers.\"\n\nVan der Veen tried to escape his comrades from prison in May 1944, but the attempt failed and van der Veen was paralyzed after being shot. He was arrested a few weeks later and then executed on June 10th, 1944. In May 1946, he was awarded the Dutch Cross of Resistance.",

Coal miners were able to survive on relief payments and donations from supporters as far away as Boston and Winnipeg. After three months of a work stoppage, the corporation planned to resume operations without any settlement with workers.\n\nTo maintain the shutdown, coal miners seized and shut down the power plant that served both the company's mines and the city of New Waterford in early June. The shortage of water and power affected New Waterford citizens, but the miners drew on local wells and set up a volunteer service to deliver water to the hospital.\n\nOn June 11th, a force of company police recaptured the power plant. Hundreds of coal miners, possibly more than 2,000 in number, marched to Waterford Lake in protest. It was there that the company police fired on the crowd, killing 38 year old William Davis.\n\nThis annual commemoration to all miners killed in labor struggle and industrial accidents became official in Nova Scotia in 2008, officially recognized as William Davis Miners' Memorial Day.",

        "description": "Medgar Evers was an American civil rights leader who achieved national prominence for his efforts in fighting racial oppression in Mississippi, work for which he was assassinated by white supremacists on this day in 1963.\n\nEvers led boycotts against businesses that discriminated against black people, worked to overturn segregation at the University of Mississippi, and fought for fair enforcement of the right to vote. He also played a key role in securing the involvement of the NAACP in the murder of Emmett Till, helping publicize the events and secretly secure witnesses for the case.\n\nEvers was assassinated on June 12th, 1963 by Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the White Citizens' Council in Jackson, Mississippi. His murder and the resulting trials inspired a wave of civil rights protests; his life inspired numerous works of art, music, and film.\n\nAll-white juries failed to reach verdicts in the first two trials of Beckwith in the 1960s. He was convicted in 1994 in a state trial based on new evidence.\n\n\"I love my children and I love my wife with all my heart. And I would die, die gladly, if that would make a better life for them.\"\n\n- Medgar Evers",

Among these provisions were the government of Cuba consenting to the right of the United States to \"intervene for the preservation of Cuban independence, the maintenance of a government adequate for the protection of life, property, and individual liberty\".\n\nFollowing acceptance of the amendment, the United States ratified a tariff that gave Cuban sugar preference in the U.S. market and protection to select U.S. products in the Cuban market. Over $200 million was spent by American companies on Cuban sugar between 1903 and 1913, and this investment into sugar led to land being concentrated into the hands of the largest sugar mills, with estimates that 20% of all Cuban land was owned by these mills.",

The Pentagon Papers were the result of a study conducted by the Department of Defense which Ellsberg had contributed to.\n\nThe study revealed that the U.S. had secretly enlarged the scope of its actions in the Vietnam War with coastal raids on North Vietnam and Marine Corps attacks, and that the Johnson administration had routinely lied to both Congress and the American public about involvement in Vietnam.\n\nFor his disclosure of the Pentagon Papers, Ellsberg was initially charged with conspiracy, espionage, and theft of government property. These charges were later dismissed after prosecutors investigating the Watergate scandal discovered that the staff members in the Nixon White House had ordered the so-called \"White House Plumbers\" to engage in unlawful efforts to discredit Ellsberg.\n\nOn January 3rd, 1973, Ellsberg was charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 along with other charges of theft and conspiracy, carrying a total maximum sentence of 115 years. Due to governmental misconduct and illegal evidence-gathering, he was dismissed of all charges on May 11th, 1973.\n\nThe Pentagon Papers were only fully declassified in June 2011.",

He later earned a PhD in African History in 1966 at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, England, at the age of 24.\n\nRodney traveled extensively and became well-known as an activist, scholar, and formidable orator. He taught at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania from 1966-67 and 1969-1974, and in 1968 at his alma mater University of the West Indies.\n\nOn October 15th, 1968, the government of Jamaica declared Rodney a \"persona non grata\" and banned him from the country. Following his dismissal by the University of the West Indies, students and poor people in West Kingston protested, leading to the \"Rodney Riots\", which caused six deaths and millions of dollars in damages.\n\nOn June 13th, 1980, Rodney was killed in Georgetown, Guyana via a bomb given to him by Gregory Smith, a sergeant in the Guyana Defence Force, one month after returning Zimbabwe.

        "description": "Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, born on this day in 1928, was an Argentine communist revolutionary, physician, military leader, and author who fought in the guerilla war against Fulgencio Batista and helped lead the new communist government.\n\nErnesto was born to an upper-class Argentine family of pre-independence Spanish (i.e. Basque and Cantabrian) and Irish ancestry. Referring to Che's restless nature, his father noted \"the first thing to note is that in my son's veins flowed the blood of the Irish rebels\".\n\nIn 1950 and 1951, he embarked on two continent-wide motorcycle journeys throughout South and Central America, observing poverty and poor working conditions that left a deep impression on his worldview. He later published a memoir of these experiences called \"The Motorcycle Diaries\", dubbed by Verso Books as \"Das Kapital meets Easy Rider\".\n\nIn 1956, Che Guevara sailed to Cuba to aid in the struggle against Batista, narrowly surviving an attack by Batista's forces after they landed on the island. He became a major figure of the Cuban Revolution, promoted by Fidel Castro to Comandante of a second army column.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Revolution's success, Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary tribunals, instituting agrarian land reform, helping spearhead a successful nationwide literacy campaign, serving as both national bank president and instructional director for Cuba's armed forces, and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism.\n\nGuevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment revolution abroad, first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and summarily executed.\n\n\"At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality.\"\n\n- Che Guevara",

        "description": "On this day in 2017, the deadliest UK residential fire since WWII began in Grenfell Tower, West London. 72 people, including children as young as six months old, were killed. As of 2022, no one has been charged for the residents' deaths. More than 70 others were injured and 223 people escaped.\n\nThe high rise apartment complex, managed by Kensington and Chelsea TMO (KCTMO) was home to working class residents, many of them immigrants. Grenfell Tower was 24 stories tall and 120 flats in total.\n\nIn the years leading up to the fire, residents and neighborhood groups made multiple complaints about the unsafe state of the complex. In 2016, Grenfell Action Group (GAG) warned that people might be trapped in the building if a fire broke out. Later that year, they stated \"only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of [KCTMO]...They can't say that they haven't been warned!\"\n\nTwo women living in Grenfell Tower, Mariem Elgwahry and Nadia Choucair, were threatened with legal action by KCTMO after they campaigned for improved fire safety. Both later died in the fire, at the ages of 27 and 33, respectively.\n\nEarly on June 14th, 2017, the Grenfell Tower Fire began with a malfunctioning freezer on the fourth floor. Because the building did not meet safety regulations, fire spread rapidly up the building's exterior, bringing fire and smoke to all residential floors.\n\nEyewitnesses reported seeing some people jumping to their deaths. Some of these deaths were classed as suicides despite being a direct consequence of the fire. Frequent explosions from gas lines (which residents claimed were unsafely exposed just months earlier) in the building were reported.\n\nA public inquiry, ordered by then Prime Minister Theresa May, is ongoing as of June 14th, 2022. Despite a 2017 statement from British police stating that they had \"reasonable grounds\" to suspect corporate manslaughter \"may have been committed\", no criminal charges have been filed.\n\nWhile justice for Grenfell Tower residents has been delayed, the British government has found the means to charge at least twenty-one people with fraud relating to damage claims regarding the fire.\n\nEdward Daffam, a member of GAG, has stated: \"They didn't give a stuff about us. We were the carcass and they were the vultures. North Kensington was like a goldmine, only they didn't have to dig for the gold. All they had to do was to marginalise the people who were living here, and that's what they were doing.\"",

It was during this period, in the decade before the Civil War, that she authored \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". Within a year of its publication, the book sold an unprecedented 300,000 copies and was widely read in both the United States and Great Britain.\n\nHarriet Stowe was also an early feminist thinker, connecting the struggle for black liberation to the struggle for women's liberation more broadly, writing in 1869 that \"the position of a married woman...is, in many respects, precisely similar to that of the negro slave. She can make no contract and hold no property; whatever she inherits or earns becomes at that moment the property of her husband...Though he acquired a fortune through her, or though she earned a fortune through her talents, he is the sole master of it, and she cannot draw a penny\".",

        "description": "Justice for Janitors (JfJ) is a social movement that fights for the rights of janitors (caretakers and cleaners) across the US and Canada. Justice for Janitors includes more than 225,000 janitors in at least 29 cities in the United States and at least four cities in Canada. Members fight for better wages, better conditions, improved health-care, and full-time opportunities.\n\nOn this day in 1990, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) attacked immigrant janitors who were striking for the right to organize in Century City, making two women miscarry, hospitalizing dozens, and jailing sixty more. Police initially claimed to be defending themselves, however TV footage was aired that undermined this claim.\n\nDespite the violence, workers voted unanimously to return to the scene of the attack and continue their protest. Janitors eventually won the right to form a union, doubling their pay and benefits. This victory gave significant momentum to the JfJ movement and led to successful protests by and organizing of janitors around the country.",

An excerpt reads:\n\n\"We need to wake up and realize that our real enemies are not in some distant land...The enemy is a system that wages war when it's profitable. The enemy is CEOs who lay us off our jobs when it's profitable. It's the insurance companies who deny us health care when it's profitable. It's the banks who take away our homes when it's profitable. Our enemies are not five thousand miles away. They are right here at home.\"",

        "description": "On this day in 1953, in what became an uprising of more than one million people, 300 East German construction workers protested at government buildings, demanding the reversal of a 10% increase in work quotas.\n\nDue to an economic slump, the East German government had increased worker quotas (called \"norms\") by 10% across all state-owned factories. At the same time, the prices of food, health care, and public transportation had all significantly increased, leading to an effective monthly wage cut of 33%, according to historian Corey Ross.\n\nAlthough the government quickly conceded on the matter of work quotas, the protests took on an anti-government character and spread quickly throughout all of East Germany. News of the initial strike had spread both through word of mouth and the Western \"Radio in the American Sector\" (RIAS), which provided sympathetic coverage of the protests.\n\nSoviet troops and tanks entered East Berlin on the morning of June 17th and violently clashed with the protesters, who had stormed government headquarters. The East German Stasi engaged in mass arrests of thousands of people.\n\nAccording to historian Richard Millington, around 39 people were killed during the uprising, the vast majority of them demonstrators. Seven Berlin victims were given an official state funeral in West Berlin on June 23rd, 1953.\n\nFollowing the uprising's successful repression, many workers lost faith in East Germany's socialist state. According to historian Gareth Pritchard, there was a widespread refusal by workers to pay their trade union dues and support the ruling party.\n\nIn response to the incident, the East German state expanded its surveillance of workers to more closely monitor discontent, creating what journalist Chris Hedges called \"the most efficient security and surveillance state\" of its time.",

        "description": "On this day in 1976, the Soweto Uprising began in South Africa after the government mandated that Afrikaans be taught in school, leading to demonstrations by more than 20,000 black schoolchildren, hundreds of whom were killed by police.\n\nThe Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974 mandated all black schools to use Afrikaans and English in equal amounts as languages of instruction. Afrikaans was strongly associated with apartheid (prominent anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu called it \"the language of the oppressor\"), and this decree was widely resented.\n\nAt first, resistance to the measure was scattered - on April 30th, the students of Orlando West Junior School went on strike, and other schools began to follow suit. Students eventually formed an Action Committee, later known as the Soweto Students' Representative Council, which organized a mass meeting on June 13th to develop a cohesive strategy of protest.\n\nOn the morning on June 16th, 10,000-20,000 students walked out of their schools to a mass rally, carrying signs reading \"Down with Afrikaans\", \"Viva Azania\", and \"If we must do Afrikaans, Vorster must do Zulu\".\n\nThe protest turned violent after students killed a trained dog that the police had sicced on them, causing the police to open fire. Among the first students to be murdered were the 15-year-old Hastings Ndlovu and the 12-year-old Hector Pieterson (shown, photo by Sam Nzima).\n\nSocial reformer Dr. Melville Edelstein was beaten to death by the mob, a sign around his neck proclaiming, \"Beware Afrikaans is the most dangerous drug for our future\". 23 people died on the first day in Soweto, and hundreds more were killed in the following weeks.\n\nEmergency clinics were swamped with injured and bloody children. Police requested for the hospital to provide a list of all victims with bullet wounds, however the doctors refused, recording bullet wounds as abscesses.\n\nThe violence led to widespread riots and sympathy protests throughout South Africa, including white students from the University of the Witwatersrand. In remembrance of these events, June 16th is now a public holiday in South Africa known as Youth Day.",

He refused to beg for clemency, instead telling the court he regretted not succeeding in his plan.\n\nSbardellotto was born into a poor family who was compelled to emigrate to find work. Angelo and his father left Italy in October 1924, living in France, Luxembourg, and Belgium, where Angelo worked as a miner and a machine hand.\n\nWhile working as a miner, he joined the anarchist committee of Liege, and was active in the activities to bring about the general strike in Belgium in solidarity with framed Italian-American anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti.\n\nAlready under surveillance as a suspected communist subversive, Sbardellotto was stopped by police in Piazza Venezia, Rome in 1932, found armed with two rudimentary bombs and a pistol, as well as possession of a Swiss passport.\n\nAdmitting to having entered Italy clandestinely with the intent of avenging socialist Michael Schirru by killing Mussolini (Schirru himself had attempted to assassinate Mussolini), Sbardellotto was interrogated and likely tortured by police before his trial a week later on June 11th.\n\nWhen Sbardellotto's lawyer requested that he write to Mussolini directly to ask for his life to be spared, he refused, stating that he was only sorry that he had not carried out the attempt on Mussolini.\n\nOn June 17th, 1932, at twenty-four years old, he was put in front of the firing squad at the Bretta Fort. He refused last rites from a priest. Angelo's last words before being shot were \"Long live anarchy!\"",

On one visit to the United States, Thompson had to flee the country due to threats of violence from pro-slavery parties.\n\nThompson was also an advocate of free trade, Chartism, nonresistance, the peace movement, and East Indian reform, helping form the British India Society in 1839.",

She graduated from medical training for paramedics and housewives the day before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. During fighting in her hometown, a wounded Soviet soldier she had been taking care of asked her why the city didn't have a strong partisan movement.\n\nWhen the soldier recovered, Kislyak contacted several partisans hiding out in a nearby forest and asked if she could join their cause, recruiting several acquaintances into the movement. With this organization, she helped kill Nazi officers, sometimes flirting with them to lure them into an isolated area where they could be killed out of sight.\n\nWhen she received word that a Gestapo agent nicknamed \"the Butcher\" would be coming to Kharkiv, she and her partisan unit spent two days planning his capture. Kislyak rented a room right next to his at the farm he was staying at.\n\nAfter courting him for a few days she lured him to a riverbank, where her conspirators captured him. After interrogating the officer, the group summarily executed him with a crowbar.\n\nIn response, more than one hundred villagers, including Mariya, were collectively arrested by the Gestapo and told they would be killed by a firing squad if the SS man wasn't found alive soon. After the plot became known, Mariya and two others were brutally tortured and interrogated for weeks.\n\nOn June 18th, the group of three was hanged and their bodies put on public display. On May 8th, 1965 she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.",

Pankhurst founded the Communist Party of Australia and, decades later, the fascist \"Australia First\" movement.\n\nAdela was born into a left-wing family - her father was socialist Richard Pankhurst and her mother was militant suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst. Her sisters Sylvia and Christabel also became leaders of the British suffrage movement.\n\nAs a teenager, Adela became involved in the militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), founded by her mother and sisters. She was arrested after interrupting Winston Churchill during a protest and slapping a policeman who was trying to evict her from the building.\n\nBoth Sylvia and Adela were socialists, while Emmeline and Christabel were more focused on winning the vote for affluent women. After Sylvia was ejected from the WSPU, Christabel is quoted by author Jeff Sparrow as telling her \"I would not care if you were multiplied by a hundred, but one of Adela is too many.\"\n\nIn 1914, Adela emigrated to Australia and advocated for peace during World War I. In 1920, Pankhurst co-founded the Australian Communist Party, although she was later expelled.\n\nDespite organizing on behalf of working class women, Adela grew disillusioned with socialist movements and co-founded two nationalist, anti-communist organizations, the Australian Women's Guild of Empire and the fascist \"Australia First\" movement. Pankhurst also expressed sympathies for both fascist Germany and Japan during World War II, for which she was imprisoned.\n\nIn 1949, Pankhurst stated the following on her disillusionment with communism: \"So long did I warn my supporters that co-operation with Russia, and all those who supported the Bolsheviks, was the way to disaster and I was ruined and interned for my pains...Communism has not brought home the bacon...Taken on achievement, Fascism did very much better while it lasted.\"",

        "description": "Harriette Moore, born on this day in 1902, was a school teacher and civil rights activist who, along with her husband, was murdered by white supremacists after their home was bombed on their 25th wedding anniversary, December 25th, 1951.\n\nHarriette's husband, Harry Moore, was also a civil rights activist, and together they founded the Florida state chapter of the NAACP. In 1946, they were both fired by the Brevard County public school system and blacklisted due to their political activities.\n\nOn their 25th wedding anniversary (December 25th, 1951), the Moore home in Mims, Florida was bombed by white supremacists. The local hospital would not treat black people, and Harry died on the way to the nearest one that would, 30 miles away in Sanford, Florida.\n\nHarriette died from her wounds nine days later, on January 3rd, 1952, at the same hospital. Their deaths were two of the earliest assassinations in the civil rights movement.\n\nAlthough the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated their murders, no one was ever prosecuted. A state investigation and forensic work in 2005 identified four Ku Klux Klan members who likely committed the bombing, however they had all been dead for many years.",

        "description": "On this day in 1896, nearly 1,000 miners of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) walked off the job for higher wages, causing a lockout that shut down all mines in the district and the WFM to turn to revolutionary socialist politics.\n\nThe Leadville miners' strike was initiated by the Cloud City Miners' Union, the Leadville, Colorado local of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), against those silver mines paying their workers less than $3.00 per day, approximately $32 in 2021 American currency. The action was taken after a near unanimous vote from more than 1,000 miners the same day.\n\nOn June 22nd, mine owners in the area banded together, agreeing to a district-wide worker lockout and signing a secret agreement to maintain a unified front against the union: none of them would recognize the union or negotiate with it, and that no participant would agree to any concessions except by majority vote of the owners.\n\nLeadville mine owner John Campion hired labor spies from both the Thiel Detective Agency and the Pinkerton Agency to spy on the union. Campion hired additional spies to report on activities of replacement workers imported from Missouri. The owners used their spies to develop a blacklist and exploit divisions among the striking workers.\n\nAt the time the WFM was associated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), a more moderate union. Other WFM locals, particularly the Butte, Montana local, sent financial support to the strikers, but the AFL refused to provide both financial support and to call other union locals out in sympathy strikes.\n\nOn September 21st, a group of approximately 50 armed strikers began a series of pre-meditated attacks on mines in the area, attempting to destroy them with bombs and a homemade cannon. Four miners, all found to be members of the WFM, were killed, along with one fireman. This led to widespread arrests of WFM members and the arrival of the National Guard to the area.\n\nThe strike was defeated on March 9th, 1897. The failure of the strike to succeed caused the WFM to leave the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and turn towards more radical anti-capitalist politics. The WFM would go on to play a key role in founding the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905.",

While not Mayan himself, Marcos has often served as the group's spokesman.\n\nMarcos led the EZLN during the 1994 revolt and the subsequent peace negotiations, during a counter-offensive by the Mexican Army in 1995, and throughout the decades that followed.

In 1887, Parsons, with three others, was executed by the state during the Haymarket Affair.\n\nLucy Parsons was a well-known radical labor activist in her own right, dubbed by the Chicago Police Department as \"more dangerous than a thousand rioters\".\n\nAfter fighting in the Civil War, Albert settled in Texas and became an activist for the rights of former slaves, later serving a Republican official during reconstruction. With Lucy, he moved to Chicago in 1873, working for radical newspapers and engaging in labor organizing.\n\nIn 1879, Parsons withdrew from all participation in electoral politics. In his memoirs, Albert writes \"In 1879 I withdrew from all active participation in the political Labor Party, having been convinced that the number of hours per day that the wage-workers are compelled to work, together with the low wages they received, amounted to their practical disfranchisement as voters...\n\n\"...My experience in the Labor Party had also taught me that bribery, intimidation, duplicity, corruption, and bulldozing grew out of the conditions which made the working people poor and the idlers rich, and that consequently the ballot-box could not be made an index to record the popular will until the existing debasing, impoverishing, and enslaving industrial conditions were first altered.\"\n\nIn 1887, Parsons became one of four Chicago labor leaders convicted of conspiracy and hanged following the Haymarket affair, in which a workers' rally for the eight hour day devolved into a riot and anti-worker hysteria.\n\nParsons' final words on the gallows were \"Will I be allowed to speak, oh men of America? Let me speak, Sheriff Matson! Let the voice of the people be heard! O-\", but his words were cut short by the opening of the trap door.\n\nLucy Parsons continued her activism after his death, going on to help found the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).\n\n\"Formerly the master selected the slave; today the slave selects his master, and he has got to find one or else he is carried down here to my friend, the gaoler.\"\n\n- Albert Parsons",

In 1948, he enrolled in Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, South Africa but was expelled after one year there, following the rise of the Apartheid government.\n\nMondlane eventually came to the United States, enrolling at Oberlin College in Ohio at the age of 31 under a Phelps Stokes scholarship, graduating in 1953 with a degree in anthropology and sociology.\n\nMondlane later became an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Syracuse University and helped develop the East African Studies Program there. In 1963, he resigned from his post at Syracuse to move to Tanzania, co-founding the Mozambican Liberation Front (FRELIMO) to fully engage in armed liberation struggle, receiving aid from both the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.\n\nIn 1969, Mondlane was assassinated by a bomb planted in a book, sent to him at the FRELIMO Headquarters in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The killing remains unsolved to this day, although former Portuguese agent Oscar Cardoso claims that fellow agent Casimiro Monteiro planted the bomb.\n\nFRELIMO went on to successfully win power and an independent Mozambique in 1975.",

Peronism was a popular third positionist political movement that had elements of left and right-wing political ideas.\n\nOn June 20th, 1973, Juan Per\u00f3n was returning to Argentina after eighteen years of political exile in fascist Spain. A large crowd gathered to witness his return at Ezeiza International Airport; police estimated three and a half million people total were present.\n\nAt the time, an alliance of right-wing and left-wing movements existed within Peronism, with the Peronist Youth and the Montoneros exhibiting anti-capitalist politics. While the crowd was gathered at the airport, right-wing snipers began firing on the crowd, targeting the Peronist Youth and Montoneros, killing at least 13 people and injuring 365 more.\n\nThe Ezeiza massacre marked the end of the alliance of the left and right-wing Peronists which Per\u00f3n had managed to forge. According to Hugo Moreno, \"If [the general strike on] October 17th, 1945 may be considered as the founding act of Peronism...the June 20th, 1973 massacre marked the entrance on the scene of the late right-wing Peronism.\"",

Depiction of the massacre shown is by Paul Cadmus.\n\nThe violence took place in a coal mining area during a nationwide strike called months prior by the United Mineworkers of America (UMWA). The owner of the local Illinois mine, W.J. Lester, negotiated with the union to allow his mine to remain open and for miners to go back to work, as long as no coal was shipped out.\n\nBy June, over 60,000 tons of coal had been dug up and Lester decided to break his agreement and attempted to sell the coal. Early in the morning of June 21st, a truck carrying Lester's guards and strikebreakers was ambushed near Carbondale, Illinois on its way to the mine. The union miners marched into Herrin, looted the hardware store of its firearms and ammunition, and laid siege to the mine.\n\nThe strikebreakers working in the mine surrendered to the union workers firing on them and were captured as prisoners. Despite promises of safety, they were brutally tortured and massacred by the union miners.\n\nSix strikebreakers were ordered to remove their shirts and shoes and told to crawl to Herrin Cemetery. A large crowd watched as the scabs were roped together, and union men took turns beating, shooting them, and urinating on them.\n\nIn total, twenty-three workers were killed, most of whom were members of the strikebreaking group. W.J. Lester, the owner of the mine, made a significant sum from selling his mine after the massacre occurred.",

This led to the Long Strike of 1875, which lasted seven months and compelled the governor order in troops to the region.\n\nWhen the Long Strike failed, some Irish-American miners turned to tactics that had been employed in Ireland in the late 17th and 18th centuries, using oath bound societies, anonymous threats and in some cases violent retribution on those deemed hostile to their community. The Molly Maguires emerged from this historical backdrop.\n\nIn 1876-77, twenty suspected Molly Maguires were convicted of murder and other crimes on the basis of dubious evidence (mostly testimony from notorious Pinkerton Agent James McParland).\n\nOn June 21st, 1877, six of the convicted men were hanged in the prison at Pottsville, and four at Mauch Chunk, Carbon County (modern day Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania). American labor historian Philip Foner concluded that the men were likely framed due to their labor activism.",

Until January 1st, 1867, the bill specified, only free black people and loyal white people would be allowed access to these lands. Homesteaders were required to occupy and improve the land for five years before acquiring full ownership.\n\nSouthern bureaucrats often obstructed or violated the law, not informing black people of their right to land (thus delaying and allowing Confederates to be eligible, from 1867 onwards). It was also difficult for freed slaves to take advantage of the opportunity, often lacking seed, animals, and farm tools.\n\nDespite this, free black people entered about 6,500 claims to homesteads, 1,000 of which eventually resulted in property certificates. The law was repealed a decade later as part of a growing cooperation between Northern and Southern capitalists. This cooperation became more explicit with the Compromise of 1877, which resulted in the end of Reconstruction and federal troops withdrawing from Southern states.",

        "description": "On this day in 1966, the Japanese government announced the construction of an airport on farmland in rural Sanrizuka, without permission of displaced locals. The plans led to decades of resistance from locals in alliance with leftist groups.\n\nThe area around Sanrizuka had been farmland since the Middle Ages, and, prior to the 1940s, much of the land had been privately owned by the Japanese Imperial Household.\n\nMany locals were economically reliant on the Imperial estate at Gory\u014d Farm, and local farmers had a strong economic and emotional attachment to the land. After Japan's defeat in World War II, large tracts of royal land were sold off and subsequently settled by poor rural laborers.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Japanese government planned to build a second airport in the Tokyo area to support Japan's rapid economic development. After meeting resistance from locals on the site's first chosen location, the rural town of Tomisato, the government was donated remaining land in Sanrizuka by the Imperial Family.\n\nLocals in Sanrizuka were outraged when the government announced its plans. The Sanrizuka-Shibayama United Opposition League Against the Construction of Narita Airport (or Hantai D\u014dmei) was formed in 1966, and began to engage in a variety of tactics of resistance, including legal buy-ups, sit-ins, and occupations.\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese radical student movement was growing, and the League soon formed an alliance with active New Left groups; one major factor drawing the groups the together was that, under the US-Japan Security Treaty, the US military had free access to Japanese air facilities. As a result, it was likely the airport would be used for transporting troops and arms in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe demonstrators built huts and watchtowers along proposed construction sites. On October 10th, 1967, the government attempted to conduct a land survey, backed by over 2000 riot police. Clashes quickly broke out, and Hantai Domei leader Issaku Tomura was photographed being brutalized by police, further inflaming anti-airport sentiment.\n\nProtests further grew and intensified over the next few years as the state pressed on with attempts to build the airport. Protestors would dig into the ground, build fortifications, and arm themselves against police. Construction was delayed by years, and the conflict would cost the government billions of yen. \n\nOn September 16th, 1971, three police officers were killed during an eminent domain expropriation. Four days later, police forcibly removed and destroyed the house of an elderly woman, an incident that became yet another symbol of state oppression to the opposition. \n\nOne student committed suicide, saying in his suicide note that \"I detest those who brought the airport to this land\". In 1972, the protestors built a 60 meter-high steel tower near the runway in order to disrupt flight tests. Conflict continued through much of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1977, the government announced plans to open the airport within the year. In May, police destroyed the tower while demonstrators attempted to cling on to it, provoking a new wave of widespread conflict. One protestor was killed after being struck in the head by a tear gas canister. In March 1978, the first runway was set to open, but a few days prior, a group of saboteurs burrowed into the main control tower, barricaded themselves inside, and proceeded to lay waste to the tower's equipment and infrastructure, delaying the opening yet again to May 20th, 1978.\n\nResistance continued after the airport was opened. Although many locals began to accept the airport and leave the land, the focus of Hantai D\u014dmei shifted to opposing plans for additional terminals and runways, as the airport's current size still only reflected a fraction of initial plans.\n\nClashes continued through the 1980s - on October 20th, 1985, members of the communist New Left group Chukaku-ha broke though police lines with logs and flagpoles, successfully attacking infrastructure in one of the last large-scale battles of the resistance campaign. Guerilla actions and bombings continued as late as the 1990s.\n\nAlthough this campaign of resistance has largely shifted out of public attention in Japan, its presence is still felt: until 2015, all visitors were required to present ID cards for security reasons, and the airport still remains only a third of its initially-planned size. The Sanrizuka Struggle has never completely ended, and the Opposition League still exists and holds rallies.",

In sections of the city, hundreds of barricades were thrown up. The National Guard was sent in to quell the rebellion, and workers seized weapons from local armories to fight back.\n\nThe violence, which lasted just three days, resulted in more than 10,000 casualties and 4,000 participants to be deported to Algeria. Among the dead was Denis Auguste Affre, Archbishop of Paris, killed while trying to negotiate peace with an angry crowd.\n\nThe rebellion was successfully crushed, and the episode put a hold on revolutionary ambitions of radical Republicans at the time. In its aftermath, the French Constitution of 1848 was adopted, mandating that executive power be wielded by a democratically elected president.\n\nThe first president under this framework was Napoleon Bonaparte, who dissolved the constitution during his first term in office.",

Truman, with many Democrats defecting from the party line to support the union-busting measure.\n\nThe Act was introduced in the aftermath of a major, unprecedented wave of strikes in the aftermath of World War II, from 1945-1946. Strikes were strongly repressed during World War II to not hamper the war effect. When the wartime restrictions ended, millions of workers across the country went on strike.\n\nThe Taft-Hartley Act prohibits unions from engaging in \"unfair labor practices.\" Among the practices prohibited by the act are jurisdictional strikes, wildcat strikes, solidarity or political strikes, secondary boycotts, secondary and mass picketing, closed shops, and monetary donations by unions to federal political campaigns. The Act also allowed states to pass right-to-work laws banning union shops.\n\nA pamphlet supporting a third, progressive party, published in 1948, had this to say on the vote:\n\n\"Every scheme of the lobbyists to fleece the public became law in the 80th Congress. And every constructive proposal to benefit the common people gathered dust in committee pigeonholes. The bi-partisan bloc, the Republocratic cabal which ruled Congress and made a mockery of President Roosevelt's economic bill of rights, also wrecked the Roosevelt foreign policy. A new foreign policy was developed. This policy was still gilded with the good words of democracy. But its Holy Grail was oil...\n\nThe Democratic administration carries the ball for Wall Street's foreign policy. And the Republican party carries the ball for Wall Street's domestic policy. Of course the roles are sometimes interchangeable...\n\nOn occasion President Truman still likes to lay an occasional verbal wreath on the grave of the New Deal. But the hard facts of roll call votes show that Democrats are voting more and more like Republicans. If the Republican Taft-Hartley bill became law over the President's veto, it was because many of the Democrats allied themselves to the Republicans.\"",

He was married to Anne Braden, a prominent civil rights activist in her own right.\n\nIn 1954, to sidestep the residential race segregation in Louisville, Kentucky, the Bradens purchased a house in an all-white neighborhood and deeded it over to the Wades, an African-American family who had been unsuccessfully seeking a suburban residence. White segregationists responded by burning a cross in the yard, shooting into the home, and eventually destroying the building entirely with dynamite.\n\nFor his role in the affair, Carl Braden was charged with sedition, his work for racial integration being interpreted as an act of communist subversion. He was convicted on December 13th, 1954 and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.\n\nImmediately upon his conviction, Carl Braden was fired from his job and blacklisted from local employment. He served seven months of his sentence before he was released on a $40,000 bond, the highest bond ever set in Kentucky up to that time.\n\nOn appeal, Carl's case made it to the Supreme Court (Braden v. United States, 1961), which ruled that Braden's conviction was constitutional, although this was later overturned.\n\nIn 1967, the Bradens were again charged with sedition for protesting the practice of strip-mining in Pike County, Kentucky.",

        "description": "The Radom Riots began in Poland on this day in 1976 when tens of thousands of people began protesting and rioting in response to government increases in the price of food, chanting \"We want bread and freedom\" and fighting with police. This uprising took place in the context of social unrest throughout the country.\n\nThat morning, workers at multiple factories across Radom went on strike. By 11 am, thousands of protesters surrounded an administrative building in the city.\n\nAfter waiting for an official decision on the issue of food increases for several hours, the crowd broke into the building, which had been evacuated, looting and setting it on fire and barricading the surrounding streets.\n\nBecause the state did not plan on Radom having an uprising of this size, police forces were initially overwhelmed and reinforcements did not arrive until later that afternoon.\n\nApproximately 20,000 people battled with police forces. 198 people were wounded, 634 arrested, and several were killed. A few weeks after the uprising, a Roman Catholic priest died after being beaten by police, having joined the rioters and criticized the government in his sermons.\n\nDespite the government crackdown, the price raises were reversed within 24 hours. The 1976 workers' protest against official economic policy was a watershed moment in dissent against the Polish People's Republic.",

The event, also known as the Battle of the Greasy Grass, was one of the most significant military actions in the Great Sioux War.\n\nThe battle began on the morning of June 25th when Colonel Custer led an attack on an encampment of combined tribes. His strategy was to seize as many \"non-combatants\" as possible (i.e., women, the disabled, and children), and force the men to surrender to protect their families.\n\nCuster drastically underestimated the amount of indigenous people present, however, and no member of his attacking battalion survived their charge on the camp. Despite the victory, the seizure of indigenous lands continued unabated. Days after the battle, Crazy Horse (a leader in the Sioux resistance) surrendered to the government and died in state custody.\n\nAs a result of the Battle of Little Bighorn, the U.S. government threatened to withhold all food aid to reservations if the Sioux did not cease hostilities and cede South Dakota land. Threatened with starvation, they complied in 1877.",

        "description": "George Orwell, born on this day in 1903, was an English democratic socialist author. His experiences in the Spanish Civil War led him to rabidly oppose Soviet communism, views expounded upon in Animal Farm and Homage to Catalonia.\n\nOrwell's work is characterized by polished prose, social criticism, opposition to what Orwell called \"totalitarianism\", and support for democratic socialism.\n\nAs a writer, Orwell produced literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and polemical journalism. Among his most famous works are his allegory for the Soviet Union \"Animal Farm\" (1945) and the dystopian novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (1949). Orwell is also noted for his first hand-account of the Spanish Civil War, \"Homage to Catalonia\" (1938).\n\nIn \"Homage to Catalonia\", Orwell writes about fighting for the Republican faction, describing in detail the ways in which the anarchist movement re-structured their economy and military to be more egalitarian. He was shot in the throat but survived, declared unfit for service, and returned to England to recover.\n\nOrwell's experiences with anarchist and Bolshevik movements in Catalonia made him a vehement anti-communist later in life. In 1949, shortly before he died, Orwell prepared a list of notable people he considered unsuitable as possible writers for the anti-communist propaganda activities of the British government.\n\nThe action drew widespread criticism from other left-wing figures; Scottish journalist Alexander Cockburn referred to the notebook as \"a snitch list\" and noted Orwell's homophobia and racist comments on various individuals on the list as demonstrative of his bigotry.\n\nDespite his vehement opposition to the Soviet Union and associated communist movements, Orwell continued to identify as a democratic socialist and authored essays such as \"The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius\" (1940) that advocated for socialism, as Orwell understood it, in the United Kingdom.",

He was shot on the second day of his \"March Against Fear\" against voter discrimination.\n\nIn 1962, Meredith became the first black student admitted to the segregated University of Mississippi after a violent protest against his admission, known as the \"Ole Miss Riot\", was quelled by the federal government.\n\nInspired by President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address, Meredith decided to exercise his constitutional rights and apply to the University of Mississippi, hoping to put pressure on the Kennedy administration to enforce civil rights for African Americans.\n\nIn 1966, Meredith planned a solo 220-mile March Against Fear from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi, in protest of racial discrimination in voter registration. The second day, he was shot by a white sniper. Leaders of civil rights organizations and unions, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Walter Reuther, vowed to complete the march in his name after he was taken to the hospital.\n\nWhile Meredith was recovering, more people from across the country became involved as marchers. When the estimated 15,000 marchers reached Jackson, Mississippi, with Meredith on its front lines, it became the largest civil rights march in Mississippi history.",

        "description": "On this day in 1950, the northern Korean People's Army crossed the 38th parallel in an offensive to crush the Republic of Korea, an imperialist puppet state established by the U.S., marking the beginning of the Korean War.\n\nAlthough June 25th, 1950 is where the beginning of the Korean War is traditionally marked, other interpretations of the conflict exist.\n\nHistorian Stephen Gowans, author of \"Patriots, Traitors and Empires: The Story of Korea's Struggle for Freedom\", notes that some analysts, including a member of the U.S. State Department, consider the Korean War to have begun with the creation of the U.S.-imposed Republic of Korea on August 15th, 1948, and some consider the conflict of 1950-53 an extension of a civil war that began in 1932, when Kim Il-sung formed his first guerrilla unit to fight Japanese colonizers.\n\nIn any case, the Korean War of 1950-53 was fought between two states that both lay claim to all of the Korean Peninsula, the northern Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the southern Republic of Korea (ROK).\n\nThe ROK had been established by the occupying U.S. military government in 1948. In 1945, the same military government had banned the left-leaning People's Republic of Korea, which was based on a network of worker's committees whose program consisted of pro-labor reforms, such as the abolition of child labor and the eight hour day.\n\nOn June 25th, 1950, the DPRK People's Army crossed the 38th Parallel into ROK territory, intending to crush the state of U.S.-collaborationists. Two days later, the United Nations Security Council, then boycotted by the Soviet Union for not acknowledging the People's Republic of China (PRC), recommended member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea.\n\nThe conflict became a proxy war between global superpowers, with the DPRK supported by the Soviet Union and PRC and the ROK supported by the U.S. On July 27th, 1953 the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, creating the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to separate North and South Korea. Despite this, no peace treaty was ever signed and the two governments remain at war to this day.\n\nThe Korean War was among the most destructive conflicts of the modern era, with approximately 3 million war fatalities, 10% of the total Korean population, a larger proportional civilian death toll than both World War II and the Vietnam War according to historian Charles Armstrong.\n\nThe U.S. led a massive, scorched earth bombing campaign against North Korea, making North Korea one of the most heavily bombed countries in human history. Armstrong writes \"U.S. planes dropped 635,000 tons of bombs on Korea - that is, essentially on North Korea - including 32,557 tons of napalm, compared to 503,000 tons of bombs dropped in the entire Pacific theatre of World War II. It incurred the destruction of virtually all of Korea's major cities.\"\n\nThis campaign of destruction was essential to the success of U.S. intervention: American General Matthew Ridgway stated that, except for air power, \"the war would have been over in 60 days with all Korea in Communist hands\".",

When Morris was nine years old, she and her brother, Basil, left their maternal grandmother in Jamaica and joined her parents in Lavender Hill, South London.\n\nOn November 15th, 1969, Morris was beaten and sexually harassed by London police for interfering when they were beating Nigerian diplomat Clement Gomwalk for existing while black outside \"Desmond's Hip City\", Brixton's first black records store. Basil described her injuries from the incident, saying that he \"could hardly recognize her face, they beat her so badly\".\n\nOlive later became a member of the youth section of the British Black Panther Movement (later called the Black Workers Movement), along with activists such as Linton Kwesi Johnson, Clovis Reid and Farrukh Dhondy. Olive was also a founding member of the Brixton Black Women's Group.\n\nMorris also squatted at 121 Railton Road, Brixton in 1973. This squat became a hub of political activism and hosted community groups such as Black People Against State Harassment. The building was also the site of the Sabarr Bookshop, one of the first black community bookshops in the area. The site subsequently became an anarchist project, known as the 121 Centre, which existed until its eviction in 1999.\n\nIn 1979, Morris died prematurely from non-Hodgkinson's lymphoma at the age of 27.",

His administration gave educational grants to indigenous children, implemented literacy programs in impoverished areas, and established a minimum wage for workers of all ages.\n\nOn September 11th, 1973, the military ousted Allende in a coup d'\u00e9tat assisted by Henry Kissinger and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nAs troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, Allende gave his final speech to the public, vowing not to resign.

        "description": "On this day in 1950, U.S.-backed South Korean President Syngman Rhee ordered the mass murder of suspected communists following the outbreak of the Korean War, resulting in the summary executions of 60,000 - 200,000 Koreans.\n\nTwo days prior, the North Korean People's Army had crossed the 38th parallel to liberate South Korea from the U.S. collaborationist Republic of Korea (ROK). The ROK was established by the occupying U.S. military government in 1948, following the conclusion of World War II.\n\nOn June 27th, 1950, ROK President Syngman Rhee ordered the mass executions of people associated with the National Bodo League, a state-run re-education program for suspected communists, and the South Korean Worker's Party (WPSK).\n\nOver the following weeks, ROK officials executed many thousands of Koreans. Estimates of the total killed vary widely, from 60,000 to 200,000. Official U.S. documents show that American officers witnessed and photographed the massacre, and in at least one case, an American lieutenant colonel approved of one episode of mass executions.\n\nThe South Korean government falsely blamed the murders on communists led by Kim Il-sung and suppressed public knowledge of the massacre for decades afterward. Beginning in the 1990s, several corpses were excavated from mass graves, raising public awareness of the massacre.\n\nIn 2009, the National Archives in Washington D.C. released declassified photographs of U.S. soldiers at execution sites, confirming that the American military knew and did nothing to stop the mass killing.",

She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of \"propaganda of the deed\".\n\nFrick survived the attempt on his life, and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed for \"inciting to riot\" and illegally distributing information about birth control.\n\nAfter their release from prison, Goldman and Berkman were again arrested and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of the October Revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power, Goldman changed her opinion in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion, denouncing the Soviet Union for its repression of political dissent. She left the Soviet Union and, in 1923, published a book about her experiences, \"My Disillusionment in Russia\".\n\nGoldman was an extremely well-known anarchist in her lifetime, with a reputation as a powerful orator. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, free love, and homosexuality.\n\n\"If I can't dance, I don't want to be part of your revolution.\"\n\n- Emma Goldman",

His agrarian reform, which uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers benefited approximately 500,000 people, most of them indigenous, whose ancestors had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion.\n\nThis land reform alienated the powerful United Fruit Company, the largest land owner in Guatemala at the time, which lobbied the U.S. government to have him overthrown. The U.S., also concerned by the presence of communists in the Guatemalan government, began planning a coup, to be led by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nThe CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on June 18th and was backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare, which included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news.\n\nAlthough the invasion force's military actions fared poorly, the psychological warfare and fear of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. \u00c1rbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on this day in 1954. He was succeeded in power by Carlos Castillo Armas, the same man who led the invading force.",

Debs, the SP leader who ran for U.S. president from his prison cell in 1920.\n\nKeller supported striking workers, including those murdered in the 1914 Colorado Ludlow Massacre, calling owner John D. Rockefeller a \"monster of capitalism.\" She defined herself as a \"militant suffragist\", campaigning for women's right to vote because she believed this was linked to the struggle for socialism.\n\nContemporary critics either lambasted Keller for her radical politics or attempted to neutralize her as a \"wonder woman\". In a 1924 letter to a U.S. Senator, Keller wrote \"So long as I confine my activities to social service and the blind, they compliment me extravagantly, calling me 'arch priestess of the sightless,' 'wonder woman,' and a 'modern miracle.' But when it comes to a discussion of poverty, and I maintain that it is the result of wrong economics - that the industrial system under which we live is at the root of much of the physical deafness and blindness in the world - that is a different matter!\"\n\nBy the time Keller died in 1968, at the age of 87, she had been under FBI surveillance for most of her adult life.",

Franco began working to support her family at eleven years old and raised her daughter while working as a preschool teacher for minimum wage.\n\nAs an adult, Franco earned a master's degree in public administration from the Fluminense Federal University. Her master's thesis was titled \"UPP: The Reduction of the Favela to Three Letters\", and dealt with a law enforcement program to retake control of Rio's favelas from gangs.\n\nIn 2016, Franco ran for Rio de Janeiro City Council and won her seat with more than 46,500 votes. As a city council member, Franco fought against violence against women, for reproductive and gay rights, and for the rights of favela residents.\n\nOn March 14th, 2018, Franco attended a round-table discussion titled \"Young Black Women Moving [Power] Structures\" (Portuguese: Jovens Negras Movendo Estruturas). Two hours after leaving the talk, Franco and her driver were assassinated by two men driving another car.

As Nikita Kruschev was pushing \"de-Stalinization\" reforms, there were growing debates in Poland about the country's political future.\n\nWorkers in the largest factory of Poznan, Cegielski's Metal Industries, were disgruntled, wanting lower taxes and work quotas. When the government reneged on promises made to these workers on June 26th, 80% of the factory workers walked out on the morning on June 28th.\n\nThe strike quickly grew into a massive protest, with more than 100,000 protesters surrounding the Imperial Castle in Poznan. The demonstrators demanded lower food prices, wage increases, better working conditions, and to meet with Polish Prime Minister J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz. Some police officers joined the crowd.\n\nThe protest escalated into a full-blown riot as workers stormed a local prison and arms depot. The crowd clashed with state forces and ransacked many government buildings, including the local Communist Party headquarters, the office of the Ministry of Public Security, courthouse, prosecutor's office, and multiple police stations.\n\nThe rebellion was crushed by the Polish Army occupying Poznan with more than 10,000 troops, tanks, armored cars, and field guns. Several hundred people were arrested in the following weeks, many of whom were workers. At least fifty (some estimates say more than seventy) people were killed, including a thirteen year old boy. Several hundred more were wounded.\n\nThe uprising contributed to the Polish October (or \"Gomu\u0142ka Thaw\"), in which Poland's government temporarily liberalized and won more autonomy from Soviet control. In 1980, Solidarity, a Polish labor movement aided by the CIA, decided to raise a monument in memory of the Poznan Revolt.\n\nOn June 21st, 2006, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the events, the Polish parliament declared June 28th to be a national holiday in Poland - the \"Day of Remembrance\".",

It banned advocating for the overthrowing the state by force and required all non-citizens to register with the govt.\n\nThe law, also known as the Alien Registration Act, led to 4.7 million non-citizens registering with the federal government between August 1940 and January 1941 alone. After the U.S. entered World War II, federal authorities used data gathered from alien registrations to identify citizens of enemy nations and take 2,971 them into custody by the end of the year.\n\nApproximately 215 people were indicted under the legislation, including alleged communists, anarchists, and fascists. One of the most infamous cases involving the Smith Act was a ten-month trial of eleven communist leaders in 1949, ten of whom, including Benjamin Davis, were sentenced to multiple years in prison.\n\nProsecutions under the Smith Act continued until a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 1957 reversed a number of convictions under the Act, deeming them unconstitutional. The law has also been amended several times, but is still in effect today.",

        "description": "On this day in 1969, the Stonewall Uprising began when NYC Police raided the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. As cops arrested homosexuals and drag queens, the crowd fought them, trapping police inside and lighting the Inn on fire.\n\nIn the 1960s, New York City Robert Wagner Jr. initiated an anti-gay campaign in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of gay bars and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.\n\nThe Stonewall Inn is a prominent gay bar in Greenwich Village, New York City, then owned by the Genovese crime family and lacking a liquor license. The night of the Stonewall Uprising, approximately 200 patrons were in the bar, and four undercover cops were present before the raid was initiated.\n\nAs cops shut the bar down and began arresting patrons, a crowd began to gather outside. A scuffle broke out when a butch woman in handcuffs (thought by many to be Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie but accounts differ) fought with police for ten minutes as they attempted to arrest her.\n\nAfter she shouted to bystanders \"Why don't you guys do something?\", an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon and the crowd turned violent, attempting to overturn police cars and slashing their tires, and throwing debris at the cops, some of whom became trapped in the Inn.\n\nSome members of the mob lit garbage on fire and stuffed it through the broken windows, setting the bar on fire with police and some detainees inside. A tactical police force was deployed to free the officers, beating the crowd as they mocked police with impromptu kick lines and ironic chants.\n\nWhen the violence broke out, women and transmasculine people being held down the street at The Women's House of Detention joined in by chanting, setting fire to their belongings, tossing them into the street below, and chanting \"gay rights\".\n\nThe uprisings continued for several nights afterward, with thousands showing up outside the bar. Black drag queen and radical queer rights activist Marsha P. Johnson was seen climbing a lamppost and dropping a heavy bag onto the hood of a police car, shattering the windshield.\n\nMembers of the Mattachine Society, a gay rights organization which had taken to respectability politics, were embarrassed by the behavior at Stonewall. Randy Wicker, who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said \"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals...that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\" Others were glad to see the closing of Stonewall Inn, perceived as a \"sleaze joint\".\n\nDespite this backlash, some participants of the annual Mattachine Society picket on July 4th were emboldened. Several same-sex couples held hands as they marched despite protests from lead organizers of the picket, generating more press attention for the event than usual.\n\nThe Stonewall Uprising was a watershed moment in the history of queer liberation, to the extent that some studies of LGBT history in the U.S. are divided into pre- and post-Stonewall analyses.\n\n\"It was a rebellion, it was an uprising, it was a civil rights disobedience - it wasn't no damn riot.\"\n\n- Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie",

When the group was discovered by the fascist secret police, ORVA, Audisio was sentenced to five years confinement on the island of Ponza.\n\nReleased during World War II, he continued to resist the Mussolini's fascist government and, in September 1943, he started to organize the first bands of partisans in Casale Monferrato.\n\nBy January 1945, he had become a leading figure of the Italian resistance movement in Milan and began using the pseudonym \"Colonnello Valerio\", a name possibly also used by Luigi Longo.\n\nIt was as an official of the National Liberation Committee that he received the order to execute Mussolini and his mistress, who had been captured the day before.\n\nAlthough it is not known with certainty who pulled the trigger (various figures, including Audisio, have claimed to have executed Mussolini), the version of events with Audisio being directly responsible are generally considered the most credible.\n\nAfter the war, Audisio was elected to parliament for the Italian Communist Party, where he served for 20 years.",

In 1917, Gerber was briefly committed to a mental institution because of his homosexuality.\n\nWhen the U.S. declared war on Germany, Gerber was forced to choose between becoming interned as an enemy alien or enlist in the Army. Gerber chose the latter and served in the Army for approximately three years.\n\nDuring his time in Germany, Gerber learned about the sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld's advocacy to decriminalize and normalize homosexuality. He also traveled to Berlin, which had a thriving gay subculture.\n\nInspired by Hirschfeld's work, on December 10th, 1924, Gerber founded the Society for Human Rights, the first pro-gay organization in the United States. A black clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as the organization's first president while Gerber and six others were listed as directors.\n\nGerber set out to expand the Society's membership beyond the original seven, but had difficulty interesting anyone other than working class queer people in joining. More affluent members of Chicago's gay community refused to join his society, not wanting to ruin their reputations by being associated with homosexuality.\n\nThe Society was only a chartered organization for a few months before police arrested Gerber and several other members. Gerber was subjected to three highly publicized trials, and his defense, while ultimately successful, cost him his life savings.\n\nUnable to continue funding the Society, the group dismantled, and Gerber left for New York City, embittered that the more affluent gays of Chicago had not come to his aid for a cause he believed was designed to advance the common good.\n\n\"Is not the psychiatrist again putting the cart before the horse in saying that homosexuality is a symptom of the neurotic style of life? Would it not sound more natural to say that the homosexual is made neurotic because his style of life is beset by thousands of dangers?\"\n\n- Henry Gerber",

        "description": "On this day in 1960, the Republic of the Congo became independent from Belgian colonizers, beginning a four year period of civil war which killed approximately 100,000 people, including the country's first Prime Minister, Patrice Lumumba. The complex period of political strife is known as the \"Congo Crisis\".\n\nThe Congo had been colonized by Belgium since the late 19th century, a process initiated by King Leopold II of Belgium, who was frustrated by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige.\n\nA nationalist movement within the Belgian Congo began to gain momentum in the 1950s, consisting of rival factions such as the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), of which Patrice Lumumba (shown) was a leading figure, and Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO), led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu.\n\nFollowing major riots in Stanleyville and L\u00e9opoldville in 1959, a Round Table Conference in Brussels was held in January 1960, with leaders from all the major Congolese parties in attendance.\n\nCongolese leaders were successful in negotiating their independence to be granted within months, formally winning their independence from Belgium in late June. Within days, violence between white and black communities broke out, and the country descended into a civil war between rival political factions. Some factions, supported by powerful mining interests, began seceding from the newly founded Republic of Congo.\n\nThe United Nations sent in peacekeeping troops, which were initially welcomed by Lumumba and the central government with the idea that the UN would help suppress the secessionist states. Viewing the secessions as an internal political matter, the UN refused to use its troops to assist the central Congolese government against them.\n\nLumumba also sought the assistance of the U.S. government, led by Dwight D. Eisenhower, who refused to provide meaningful military aid. He then turned to the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide weapons, logistical and material support, which the state promptly used against the secessionists.\n\nDespite Lumumba's public proclamations that he was not a communist, the United States viewed the acceptance of aid with alarm, and Lumumba became a target of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) surveillance. Lumumba was captured and, on January 17th, 1961, executed by Belgian-assisted forces.\n\nThe factional conflict continued in the wake of Lumumba's death, with fighting and intervention coming from Western states, the United Nations, and various political groups inside the Congo.\n\nIn 1964, a group known as the Simbas initiated a rebellion based on egalitarian ideals and witchcraft. In November 1964, the Simbas rounded up the remaining white population of Stanleyville, holding them hostage in the Victoria Hotel to use as bargaining tools with the Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise (ANC).\n\nTo recover the hostages, Belgian parachute troops were flown to the Congo in American aircraft. More than 70 hostages and 1,000 Congolese civilians were killed in the rescue mission, but the vast majority of hostages were evacuated.\n\nFollowing chaotic elections in 1964, Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu took power in a military coup, assuming sweeping powers and instituting widespread political repression. Mobutu, who had played a key role in Lumumba's execution, ruled until 1997, enjoying support from the United States, France, Belgium, and China.",

On July 1st, thousands of workers, skilled and non-skilled, went on strike.\n\nFrick hired the Pinkerton Agency to guard strikebreakers brought in via barge (the factory was on a river), but strikers patrolled a ten-mile stretch of the river to prevent them from making it to the factory.\n\nOn July 6th, the Pinkertons attempted to land under cover of darkness around four in the morning, however thousands of striking workers and sympathizers were waiting for them on the riverbank. When the agents tried to land, gunfire erupted, killing four people and injuring twenty-three on both sides. The Pinkertons surrendered, and many were beaten unconscious after leaving the boat.\n\nThe strike was forcibly put down by state militia, resulting in a defeat for the workers. The Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers collapsed, and its workers returned in August.\n\nFor his role in breaking the union, anarchists Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Henry Clay Frick.",

        "description": "On this day in 1893, the Leper War on Kaua'i, also known as the Battle of Kalalau, began when members of the new colonial government arrived at Kalalau Valley to enforce a deportation order for an isolated leprosy colony there.\n\nFollowing the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, the colonizers began enforcing the 1865 \"Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy\", which involved deporting or forcibly relocating anyone who had the disease to the Kalaupapa Leprosy Colony of Kalawao, on the island of Molokai.\n\nOn June 26th, a group led by deputy sheriff Louis Stoltz ventured deep into the Kalalau Valley to enforce this order. After they established an encampment, a band of lepers led by indigenous Hawaiian man Ko'olau (shown, with his family) seized the camp, and chased the lawmen back to the coast. The following day Ko'olau shot Stoltz dead while he was attempting to arrest a man named Paoa.\n\nOn July 1st, 1893, fifteen soldiers landed in Kalalau Valley, initally without incident. Over the next two weeks, Ko'olau, along with his wife Pi'ilani, led a campaign of guerilla warfare against state forces, compelling them to give up due to their inability to Ko'olau or evade his group's attacks.\n\nTwenty seven lepers were captured and sent to Kalawao, while the remaining lepers were never harassed again. The leper community dissolved, living in individual households.\n\nKo'olau and his family remained unharmed, but hid in the valley for the remainder of his life. After Ko'olau's death, his wife Pi'ilani left the valley to share their story, which was published in 1906 as Ka Moolelo oiaio o Kaluaikoolau (\"The True Story of Kaluaikoolau\").",

The use of all-white workforces and using non-white strikebreakers was an often used tactic to break working class solidarity.\n\nAt a city council meeting, angry white workers lodged formal complaints to the mayor of East St. Louis about black migration to the city. After the meeting ended, rumors of an attempted robbery of a white man by an armed black man began to circulate through the city.\n\nIn response, white mobs formed and rampaged through downtown, assaulting any black people they could find. The mobs also stopped trolleys and streetcars, pulling black passengers out and beating them on the streets and sidewalks.\n\nOn this day in 1917, the racial violence resumed at a fever pitch, with white mobs gunning down men, women, and children and burning down the homes of black families with them trapped inside. More than one hundred people were killed.\n\nA year after the violence took place, a federal investigation of the conduct of the city government concluded that police officers fled the scenes of arson and murder, abandoning their posts and refusing to answer calls for help. Less than a dozen white people were sentenced to prison for crimes related to the riot.",

He later became an author, publishing two novels with his own illustrations and publishing a biography of the painter Matth\u0133s Maris.\n\nArondeus was active in the anti-Nazi resistance, helping forge documents to protect persecuted groups. A major obstacle to the success of this forgery was the Municipal Office for Population Registration, an Amsterdam office that contained millions of identifying records for Jews and others wanted by the Gestapo.\n\nArondeus and other members of the resistance bombed the office on March 27th, 1943, subduing the guards via injection, and succeeding in destroying approximately 800,000 documents. Arondeus was arrested on April 1st.\n\nAlthough he refused to give up the rest of his team, his notebook was found and a majority of the group were also arrested. On June 18th, Arondeus and fourteen others were tried and sentenced to death. Ardoneus pleaded guilty and took the full blame, which may have contributed to two members receiving clemency.\n\nBefore his execution, Arondeus made a point of ensuring the public would be aware that he and two other men in the group were gay, asking an acquaintance to \"Tell the people that homosexuals can be brave!\" Sometimes, this quote is translated as \"The people would know that gays are no cowards!\" or \"Tell the people that homosexuals are not by definition weak\".",

His murder and the resulting trials inspired a wave of civil rights protests; his life inspired numerous works of art, music, and film.\n\nAll-white juries failed to reach verdicts in the first two trials of Beckwith in the 1960s. He was convicted in 1994 in a state trial based on new evidence.\n\n\"I love my children and I love my wife with all my heart.

He sought assistance in stabilizing the new Congolese Republic from both the United States and the Soviet Union, accepting military aid from the latter after the U.S. refused to help him.\n\nOn Lumumba's legacy, his friend and colleague Thomas Kanza wrote \"he lived as a free man, and an independent thinker. Everything he wrote, said and did was the product of someone who knew his vocation to be that of a liberator, and he represents for the Congo what Castro does for Cuba, Nasser for Egypt, Nkrumah for Ghana, Mao Tse-tung for China, and Lenin for Russia.\"",

Her experiences made her more focused on advocacy for those who, in her view, mainstream society and the assimilationist factions of the LGBT community were leaving behind.\n\nRivera died during the dawn hours of February 19th, 2002, at St. Vincent's Hospital, of complications from liver cancer.

        "description": "Clara Zetkin, born on this day in 1857, was a German Marxist theorist, activist, and feminist, active in the revolutionary Spartacist League and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).\n\nClara Zetkin was born in Wiederau, a peasant village in Saxony, now part of the municipality K\u00f6nigshain-Wiederau. Because of the ban placed on socialist activity in Germany by Bismarck in 1878, Zetkin left for Zurich in 1882 then went into exile in Paris, where she studied to be a journalist and a translator.\n\nZetkin was very interested in women's politics, including the fight for equal opportunities and women's suffrage, though always through a socialist paradigm. She helped to develop the social-democratic women's movement in Germany; from 1891 to 1917 she edited the Social Democratic Party (SPD) women's newspaper Die Gleichheit (Equality). She also contributed to International Women's Day (IWD).\n\nAround 1898, Zetkin formed a friendship with the younger Rosa Luxemburg that lasted 20 years. Despite Luxemburg's indifference to the women's movement, they became staunch political allies on the far left of the SPD. Luxemburg once suggested that their joint epitaph would be \"Here lie the last two men of German Social Democracy.\"\n\nIn August 1932, despite having recently fallen gravely ill in Moscow, she returned to Berlin to preside over the opening of the newly elected Reichstag. There, she gave a speech urging Germany to reject fascism, stating \"all those who feel themselves threatened, all those who suffer and all those who long for liberation must belong to the United Front against fascism and its representatives in government\".\n\nWhen Hitler seized power the following year, Zetkin once again fled Germany, dying in Moscow in 1933 at the age of 76.\n\n\"The working women, who aspire to social equality, expect nothing for their emancipation from the bourgeois women's movement, which allegedly fights for the rights of women. That edifice is built on sand and has no real basis. Working women are absolutely convinced that the question of the emancipation of women is not an isolated question which exists in itself, but part of the great social question.\"\n\n- Clara Zetkin",

The speech is perhaps the most widely known of all of Frederick Douglass' writings save his autobiographies.\n\nHere is a brief excerpt:\n\n\"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.\n\nTo him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy - a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\n\nThere is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.\"",

At the time, South Korea was ruled by the unelected, anti-democratic, and anti-communist military leader Chun Doo-hwan.\n\nIn the 1980s, many student activists in universities initiated democratic struggles against Chun Doo-hwan's dictatorship, particularly after the Gwangju Massacre, in which local, armed citizens clashed with soldiers and police of the South Korean government, for which Chun Doo-hwan was later sentenced to death.\n\nOn June 10th, 1987, Chun Doo-hwan's government announced its choice of Roh Tae-woo as South Korea's president, triggering massive protests from the population.\n\nLee had been fatally struck by the canister the day prior, when students in Yonsei University demonstrated against the state on June 9th. The photograph of Lee being carried away quickly became a symbol of the subsequent protests, and he languished in critical condition over the following month.\n\nWhen Lee finally died of his wounds on July 5th, after the government had capitulated to the people's demands, more than 1.6 million people participated in his national funeral on July 9th.\n\nToday, Lee's memory is honored by the Lee Han Yeol Memorial Museum in Seoul.",

        "description": "Frida Kahlo, born on this day in 1907, was a Mexican artist and revolutionary communist known for her folk-art inspired style paintings, touching on themes on gender, race, class, self-perception, indigenous culture, and chronic pain.\n\nAlthough she had always sketched as a hobby, she did not consider visual art as a career until a severe bus accident at the age of eighteen left her bedridden for three months and with a lifetime of chronic pain. Confined to her bed, Kahlo's mother provided her with a specially-made easel, which enabled her to paint while lying down.\n\nWith a mirror placed such so that she could see herself, Kahlo began to paint self-portraits, stating \"I paint myself because I am often alone and I am the subject I know best\".\n\nInspired by Mexico's popular culture, she employed an accessible, folk art style. In 1943, Kahlo accepted a teaching position at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado, the \"La Esmeralda.\" She encouraged her students to treat her in an informal and non-hierarchical way and taught them to appreciate Mexican popular culture and folk art, and to derive their subjects from the street.\n\nFrida Kahlo was a member of the Mexican Communist Party and committed to radical anti-capitalism throughout her entire adult life. In 1951, she stated:\n\n\"I have a great restlessness about my paintings. Mainly because I want to make it useful to the revolutionary communist movement...until now I have managed simply an honest expression of my own self...I must struggle with all my strength to ensure that the little positive my health allows me to do also benefits the Revolution, the only real reason to live.\"",

Despite demands by the NAACP and National Urban League, the Act was written without the inclusion of an anti-discrimination clause, allowing both employers and racist labor unions such as the AFL and CIO to maintain white supremacist labor practices.\n\nCorporate interest was heavily against the NLRA, and, when it was challenged in court, the U.S. Supreme Court was compelled to uphold (5-4) the constitutionality of the Wagner Act in \"National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp\".\n\nThe Wagner Act would later be partially repealed and amended with the strongly anti-union Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, granting states the power to pass so-called \"right-to-work\" laws.",

        "description": "On this day in 1912, a riot broke out in Grabow, Louisiana when gunfire was exchanged between organizing lumber workers and private gunmen hired by the Galloway Lumber Company, just one event in the Louisiana-Texas Lumber War. The clash left three union workers and one company gunman dead, wounding an estimated fifty more.\n\nThe event took place in the context of workers in the sawmill town of Grabow joining the Brotherhood of Timber Workers (shown), a branch of the Lumber Workers Industrial Union (LWIU), itself affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).\n\nOn July 7th, 1912, the union workers held a series of rallies at several different company towns, including Bon Ami and Carson, alongside Grabow.\n\nThe group that went to Grabow, around 200 people, spontaneously decided to hold a rally with several speeches - labor leader Arthur L. Emerson spoke on top of a wagon to roughly 25 non-union men, plus the additional union men who had come with him.\n\nShots began between these workers and a group of four others, including Galloway Lumber owner John Galloway, in the local mill office, all of whom had later been found to be drinking before the incident. It is not known for certain which group fired first. Three union men were killed alongside one member of the private company security force. Approximately 50 more were wounded.\n\nOver the next few days, more than more than 60 workers were taken into custody by police. Although the mill owner himself was arrested, he was released without charges soon afterward. Sixty-five of the timber workers' group were brought up on charges ranging from inciting a riot to murder.\n\nThe IWW worked to aid the incarcerated workers, with \"Big Bill\" Haywood fundraising for their legal fund. The trial lasted until November 8th, and its jury returned a not guilty verdict for all of the union men. All of those arrested were set free.\n\nAlthough they had limited success in Louisiana, the LWIU successfully organized later, winning an eight-hour day and vastly improved working conditions in the Pacific Northwest after a 1917 strike. Today, there is a historical marker at the site of the riot, located on what is now the property of DeRidder Airport, Louisiana.",

Jones replied \"Well, I've got stock in these little children and I'll arrange a little publicity.\"\n\nThe march successfully won that publicity, bringing national attention to the plight of working children. On July 29th, Jones and fellow marchers arrived at Roosevelt's Sagamore Hill summer home, where he refused to meet with them.\n\nAlthough the strike was initially a failure, it galvanized support for anti-child labor laws to be passed on the national level, which finally occurred with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.",

Between this and other anti-labor crackdowns, approximately 200 members were arrested.\n\nThis suppression took place in the context of a broader political struggle against the state which was spearheaded by the union. A year earlier, the Norwegian Workers Association had delivered a petition, signed by more than 13,000 people, to King Oscar II of Sweden, demanding equality before the law, military conscription to be extended to property owners, and universal suffrage. When the government dismissed the petition, the union began agitating for revolution.\n\nThe Workers Association was one of the first major labor movements in Norway. It was founded by Marcus Thrane in 1848, who was inspired by the ongoing revolution in France. The association grew rapidly through 1849 and 1850.\n\nAt its peak, the group boasted 273 chapters and 25,000-30,000 members. Following the crackdown and Thrane's imprisonment, the movement collapsed.",

More than 4,000 miners stayed off the job, but soon the protest grew to more than 10,000 people.\n\nMine owners responded to the strike by increasing their use of slave prison labor, deputizing hundreds of armed men to confront workers, and urging Governor Braxton Bragg Comer to declare martial law and dispatch state troops into the coalfields, a request he eventually granted.\n\nEvicted from company housing, thousands of workers were forced to live in tent cities, which were later attacked by state troops.\n\nThe strike was also notable for the union's ability to unite miners across the racial divide, a development that was unusual for the United States in this period. A parade of striking black and white miners through the streets of Jasper angered members of Birmingham's business community, who denounced the UMW's interracial workforce as an insult to southern traditions and called for armed state intervention against the racially mixed strikers.\n\nIn mid-August, black UMW member William Millin was snatched from his jail cell and lynched by two mine deputies.\n\nThe strike was effectively put down after state troops destroyed the miners' tent cities on August 26th, and was officially called off by the union four days later. One year afterward, the mines' production had returned to normal.",

        "description": "On this day in 1968, in defiance of union leadership, thousands of black workers from the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) initiated a three-day wildcat strike to protest racist policies from both Chrysler and the UAW.\n\nFounded just nine weeks prior to this strike, DRUM was a radical black labor organization formed in Chrysler Corporation's Dodge Main assembly plant in Detroit, Michigan. DRUM had sister organizations at other auto companies - FRUM (Ford Revolutionary Union Movement) and ELRUM (Eldon Avenue Revolutionary Union Movement). In June 1969, these came together in the League of Revolutionary Black Workers.\n\nBefore the wildcat strike began, DRUM had circulated a newsletter with fifteen demands, including a major increase of black representation in skilled plant positions, for all Black workers to immediately stop paying union dues, and an end to racial pay discrimination inside Chrysler's South African plants.\n\nOn July 7th, 1968, DRUM held a rally outside the Chrysler plant and marched, with a conga band in tow, to the UAW Local 3 headquarters two blocks away.\n\nThere, DRUM's leaders confronted the executive board of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, issued their demands, and, dissatisfied with the response of union leadership, stated they would shut down the Dodge Main plant in defiance of union contract.\n\nThe following morning, July 8th, 3,000 DRUM workers began picketing the plant. Despite the majority of white workers crossing the picket line, plant production almost entirely stopped, costing the company the production of 1,900 cars over the duration of the strike.\n\nPolice, equipped with gas masks, broke up the picket as well as a subsequent protest at Chrysler headquarters in Highland Park. The wildcat lasted for three days and no one was fired. According to author A. Muhammad Ahmad, DRUM leadership considered the strike in overwhelming success.",

After fleeing ~eleven miles north to Lebanon, they settled in Damascus, Syria as Palestinian refugees.\n\nIn 1969, after establishing himself as an author and journalist, he joined The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and, resigned from his post as editor for the magazine Al-Anwar to edit the PFLP's weekly magazine, al-Hadaf (\"The Goal\"). He drafted a PFLP program in which the movement officially took up Marxism-Leninism, a notable departure from pan-Arab nationalist ideology.\n\nOn July 8th, 1972, at the age of 36, Kanafani was assassinated via car bomb by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad for his role in the PLFP, which claimed responsibility for the Lod Airport Massacre.\n\nThe massacre, committed by three members of the Japanese Red Army recruited by the PLFP, killed 26 people, injuring 80 others.\n\nGhassan Kanafani was an influential author, whose literary works have been translated into at least 17 languages and published in 20 countries. He began writing short stories when working as a teacher in refugee camps. Often written through the eyes of children, his stories were designed to help his students contextualize their surroundings.\n\n\"Everything in this world can be robbed and stolen, except one thing; this one thing is the love that emanates from a human being towards a solid commitment to a conviction or cause.\"\n\n- Ghassan Kanafani",

He was imprisoned by the apartheid government for more than 24 years, and served in the post-apartheid government from 1994 to 1999.\n\nGovan Mbeki was born in the Nqamakwe district of the Transkei region of South Africa, and was a member of the Xhosa ethnic group. As a teenager, Mbeki worked as a newsboy and messenger in the cities, where he witnessed urban black poverty and police repression.\n\nStarting in the 1930s, Mbeki began to serve in a variety of radical organizations - the South African Communist Party, the African National Congress (ANC), and worked as the editor of the black-owned newspaper Inkundla Ya Bantu.\n\nMbeki left journalism in 1944 and became a government-nominated member of the Transkei Territorial Authorities General Council, serving until 1950. Mbeki disparagingly referred to the council as a \"toy telephone\", stating \"You can say what you like, but your words have no effect because the wires are not connected to an exchange\".\n\nIn 1960, the apartheid state banned the ANC. In response, the ANC and the already-banned Communist Party formed a paramilitary, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK). Mbeki was involved with MK and helped the group build explosives.\n\nIn July 1963, Mbeki was arrested along with several other MK leaders, including Walter Sisulu. After the subsequent \"Rivonia Trial\", Mbeki began a 24-year prison sentence Robben Island, during which he managed to run education classes with prisoners and author several texts, including The Peasants Revolt, \"a major historical study of peasant struggles in Pondoland and Sekhukhuneland\" according to South African History Online.\n\nOn November 5th, 1987, Mbeki was released from prison. He went on to serve in South Africa's post-apartheid Senate from 1994 to 1997 as Deputy President of the Senate, and then the Senate's successor, the National Council of Provinces, from 1997 to 1999.\n\n\"Our experience over the last 20 years has shown that indeed people must themselves become their own liberators. You cannot wait for somebody else to come and rescue you.\"\n\n- Govan Mbeki",

She took an early interest in becoming educated, and later became a big exponent of education within the black community. She started a school for young black girls that later, after merging with a boys' school, became known as the \"Bethune-Cookman School\", with Bethune serving as its president on multiple occasions.\n\nBethune founded the National Council for Negro Women in 1935, established the organization's flagship journal \"Aframerican Women's Journal\", and resided as president or leader for a myriad of black women's organizations. She also was appointed as a national adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom she worked with to create the Federal Council on Negro Affairs, also known as the \"Black Cabinet.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Herb Ruffin of BlackPast.org, Bethune\u2019s friendship with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led to Bethune becoming the Director of the National Youth Administration\u2019s (NYA) Division of Negro Affairs, a post she held from 1936 to 1943. As director, she led an organization that trained tens of thousands of black youth for skilled positions that eventually became available in defense plants during World War II.\n\nFor her lifetime of activism, Bethune was deemed \"First Lady of Negro America\" by Ebony magazine in 1949 and was dubbed by the press as the \"female Booker T. Washington\". Journalist Louis E. Martin stated that \"She gave out faith and hope as if they were pills and she some sort of doctor.\"\n\n\"The drums of Africa still beat in my heart.

The bombing, later found to be personally ordered by French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, killed a freelance photographer on board named Fernando Pereira.\n\nFrance had been testing nuclear weapons on the Mururoa Atoll in French Polynesia since 1966. In 1985 eight South Pacific countries, including New Zealand and Australia, signed a treaty declaring the region a nuclear-free zone.\n\nSince being acquired by Greenpeace in 1977, Rainbow Warrior was active in supporting a number of anti-nuclear testing campaigns during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including relocating 300 Marshall Islanders from Rongelap Atoll, which had been polluted by radioactive fallout by past American nuclear tests.\n\nFor the 1985 tests, Greenpeace intended to monitor the impact of nuclear tests and place protesters on the island to observe the blasts. Three undercover French agents were on board, however, and they attached two limpet mines to Rainbow Warrior and detonated them ten minutes apart, sinking the ship.\n\nFrance initially denied responsibility, but two of the French agents were captured by New Zealand Police and charged with arson, conspiracy to commit arson, willful damage, and murder.\n\nThe resulting scandal led to the resignation of the French Defence Minister Charles Hernu, while the two agents pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to ten years in prison. They spent a little over two years confined to the French island of Hao before being freed by the French government.\n\nIn 1987, after international pressure, France paid $8.16m to Greenpeace in damages, which helped finance another ship. It also paid compensation to the Pereira family, making reparation payments of 650,000 francs to Pereira's wife, 1.5 million francs to his two children, and 75,000 francs to each of his parents.",

        "description": "On this day in 1892, violence broke out between strikers and scabs during the Coeur d'Alene Strike when union leaders discovered they had been infiltrated by a Pinkerton agent who had been providing information to the mine owners.\n\nThe miners had gone on strike to demand that a living wage of $3.50 per day be paid to every man working underground, both skilled and unskilled. This solidarity between unskilled and skilled labor (a principle known as industrial unionism) was notable for the era.\n\nOn the morning of July 11th, gunfire erupted between striking workers and scabs working in the mines. The \"battle\" was won by the striking miners after they dynamited one of the mills, destroying the building and crushing one non-union worker inside. The rest of the strikebreakers promptly surrendered and were taken prisoner.\n\nLater that evening, striking workers placed explosives beneath an ore mill and gave its manager the choice between firing the strikebreakers or having his mill destroyed. He chose the former. Before the day was over, six people were killed and dozens were wounded.\n\nFollowing this violence, martial law was declared in Coeur d'Alene and the town was under military rule by the Idaho National Guard for four months.\n\nHundreds of miners were illegally detained without hearings or formal charges. The event was disastrous for the local miners' union. In an effort to reorganize the workforce, the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was founded the following year.",

He was freed as part of the same general amnesty for political prisoners under the Weimar Republic that released Adolf Hitler.\n\nAs a cabaret performer and writer during this time, he achieved international prominence, promoting works which condemned Nazism and personally satirized Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn 1933, M\u00fchsam was arrested, with propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels labeling him as one of \"those Jewish subversives.\"\n\nWhile imprisoned, he was brutally tortured, however his spirit remained unbroken. When his captors tried to force him to sing the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\" (the Nazi's anthem), M\u00fchsam sung The Internationale, instead.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, M\u00fchsam was murdered in the Oranienburg concentration camp on July 11th, 1934.",

This was just one use of direct action by longshoremen in Longview, Washington that year.\n\nSheriff's deputies and city cops from Longview and neighboring city Kelso arrested the protesters, who did not resist. \"We have worked this dock for 70 years\", said Dan Coffman, President of ILWU Local 21, \"and to have a big rich company come in and say, 'We don't want you' is a problem. We're all together. We're going to jail as a union.\"\n\nThree days later, six hundred dock workers and supporters seized the railroad tracks that serve the Port. At 1:30 am, they stopped a train, 107 cars hauling corn, originating in Split Rock, Minnesota, headed for the Longview elevators.\n\nOn September 7th, 2011, a massive picket line of some 700 longshoremen and their supporters blocked another train from entering EGT's (a large shipping conglomerate) terminal. When cops started pepper spraying, the picketers pushed back.\n\nThe next day, longshoremen from the major Northwest ports, Seattle, Tacoma and Portland, seeing images of the ILWU president being manhandled by cops, stopped work and began destroying EGT property.\n\nAccording to news reports, the cyclone fence was torn down, grain was dumped from the train cars, and the terminal was briefly occupied by angry longshore workers. Millions of dollars were lost in shipping, warning employers how far ILWU members were willing to go to protect their jobs.",

The conflict happened south of Sterling, Colorado.\n\nThe U.S. Army attacked the Cheyenne encampment from three sides at once, aided by scouts from the Pawnee tribe, hired by the United States to facilitate their suppression of Cheyenne and Sioux resistance to colonization.\n\nArmed only with bows and arrows, the Cheyenne kept their attackers at bay until their arrows ran out. Approximately three dozen Cheyenne were killed, including some elderly, women, and children.\n\nOne U.S. soldier later recalled the murder of a fifteen year old boy, who died fighting the colonizers while the women and children attempted to escape.\n\nThe attack was a decisive victory for the United States and effectively put an end to the Dog Soldier raids. For their part, the Pawnee Scouts would later go on to play role in the Great Sioux War, fighting again as mercenaries for the U.S. The Scouts permanently disbanded after that war's conclusion.",

It is considered a precursor to the NAACP, which was founded by many of the same activists.\n\nThe Niagara Movement was organized in opposition to racial segregation and disenfranchisement, as well as the perceived conciliatory policies promoted by activists like Booker T. Washington.\n\nDuring the three day meeting, Monroe and Du Bois co-authored a \"Declaration of Principles\", which defined the group's philosophy and demands. These demands included an end to the \"convict lease\" system (prison labor), equal punishment for crimes regardless of race, and universal free education, stating \"either the United States will destroy ignorance, or ignorance will destroy the United States\".",

Wheeler.\n\nThe 16-hour journey was through desert without food and with little water. Once unloaded, the deportees, most without money or transportation, were warned against returning to Bisbee. The U.S. government soon brought in members of the US Army to assist with relocating the deportees to Columbus, New Mexico.\n\nPhelps Dodge, in collusion with the sheriff, had closed down access to outside communications, so the story was not well reported at the time.\n\nAlthough a federal commission concluded the kidnapping was done \"wholly illegal and without authority in law, either State or Federal\" and the U.S. Department of Justice ordered the arrest of 21 Phelps Dodge executives, no individual, company, or agency was ever convicted in connection with the deportations.",

The exact death toll during the New York draft riots is unknown, but historian James M. McPherson has estimated that around 120 people were killed. Most of those killed were Irish, who were the majority of the rioters.\n\nEleven black people were lynched. The event lasted three days and was suppressed by the U.S. Army on orders from President Lincoln. The race riot remains one of the largest of its kind in U.S. history.",

        "description": "On this day in 2009, one of the longest strikes in Canadian history began when miners at the Brazilian company Vale went on strike, beginning a bitter, year-long labor action marked by the use of scabs, surveillance, and illegal firings. The strike took place at the nickel mine in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, which accounts for a large share of the world's nickel supply.\n\nAfter the miners walked out, the United Steelworkers (USW) permitted 56 skilled members from the USW Local 2020 to scab on the strike, allowing Vale to restart minimal mine operations.\n\nVale also hired a \"security firm\", AFI, to spy on and harass striking workers. This included the deployment of cameras and parabolic listening devices around picket shacks.\n\nInformation gathered in this eavesdropping operation was used to illegally fire nine workers, who had to wait two years before they were exonerated.\n\nThe strike ended just short of a year later, on July 8th, 2010. Workers won significant raises and a back-to-work bonus, but also received less desirable pension plans. As part of the agreement, Vale received permission to fire 113 employees.\n\nThe strike was the longest such labor action in Canadian history, beating the previous record, set at the same nickel mine (then owned by Inco) in 1978. Workers at Vale again went out on strike in June 2021. One of those strikers, Mark Lambovitch, had participated in the 2009-10 strike, and had this to say:\n\n\"I don't want to do that again, and I'm sure no one does, but we have to stand up for ourselves. Otherwise, we will just keep losing. This company makes billions of dollars, and they just can't give us a fair deal? If you come underground, do the work we do and see the conditions, we're not being greedy.\"",

        "description": "Buenaventura Durruti, born on this day in 1896, was a prominent anarchist revolutionary who organized socialist resistance in Spain, participating in general strikes and leading the Durruti Column during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nAt age fourteen, Durruti left school to become a trainee mechanic in the railway yard in Le\u00f3n. Like his father, he joined the socialist Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores (UGT).\n\nHe later took an active part in a 1917 strike that was brutally repressed by the Spanish Army. Seventy people were killed, five hundred were injured, and at least 2,000 of the strikers were imprisoned without trial or legal process. Although Durruti managed to escape to France, the violence of state repression left a strong impression on a young Durruti.\n\nWith Juan Garc\u00eda Oliver, Francisco Ascaso, Miguel Garcia Vivancos, Alfonso Miguel, Ricardo Sanz, and Aurelio Hernandez, he founded Los Solidarios (\"The Solidarity\"), a notable \"grupo de afinidad\" implicated in the assassination of Cardinal Juan Soldevilla y Romero.\n\nWorking with the CNT-FAI, Durruti helped coordinate armed resistance to the military rising of the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War, an effort which was to prove vital in preventing General Goded's attempt to seize control of Barcelona. On July 24th, 1936 Durruti led over 3,000 armed anarchists (later known as the Durruti Column) from Barcelona to Zaragoza.\n\nHe was mortally shot under disputed circumstances on November 19th, dying the next day. A few hours after Durruti's death, CNT-FAI troops massacred 52 policemen, who had been held captive in a monastery in Calle de Santa Engracia, in reprisal.\n\n\"It is we who built these palaces and cities, here in Spain and in America and everywhere. We, the workers. We can build others to take their place. And better ones! We are not in the least afraid of ruins. We are going to inherit the earth. There is not the slightest doubt about that. The bourgeoisie might blast and ruin its own world before it leaves the stage of history. We carry a new world here, in our hearts...That world is growing in this minute.\"\n\n- Buenaventura Durruti",

West Virginia Governor Henry M. Mathews sent in National Guard units to restore train service. When the soldiers refused to fire on the workers, he appealed for federal troops.\n\nBecause of economic problems and pressure on wages by the railroads, workers in numerous other states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Illinois, and Missouri, also went out on strike. At its height, the labor action was supported by approximately 100,000 workers nationwide.\n\nThe strike finally ended about 69 days later, forcibly put down by a combination of unofficial militias, the National Guard, and federal troops. An estimated 100 people were killed across the country and more than one hundred million dollars worth of property was damaged, in part from workers destroying the railroad's buildings, engines, and railroad cars.\n\nDue to this unrest and other, later labor efforts, the B&O became the first major employer in the United States to offer a pension plan in 1884.",

The Bastille was an armory and prison, perceived by many as a symbol of royal authority in the city.\n\nOn the morning of July 14th, a crowd of approximately one thousand people surrounded the Bastille, calling for the surrender of the prison, the removal of its cannon, and the release of the arms and gunpowder stored there.\n\nAfter negotiations stalled, the crowd surged into the courtyard of the Bastille and were fired upon by troops in the garrison. In the carnage that followed, ninety-eight protesters and one defender of the Bastille were killed.\n\nGovernor Marquis de Launay, fearing his troops could not hold out, capitulated to the crowd and opened up the Bastille doors. He was captured and dragged towards the H\u00f4tel de Ville in a storm of abuse. While the crowd debated his fate, the badly beaten Launay shouted \"Enough! Let me die!\", kicked a pastry cook in the groin, and was then promptly stabbed to death.\n\nAs news of the successful seizure of the Bastille spread throughout the country, revolutionaries established parallel structures of power for government and militias for civic protection, burned deeds of property, and in some cases attacked wealthy landlords.\n\nKing Louis XVI first learned of the storming the next morning through the Duke of La Rochefoucauld. \"Is it a revolt?\" asked the King. The duke replied: \"No sire, it's not a revolt; it's a revolution.\"",

Likely born into slavery in St. Thomas, Vesey was enslaved by Captain Joseph Vesey in Bermuda.\n\nAt the age of 32, he won a lottery and bought his freedom, but was unable to buy the freedom of his wife and children. In 1818 he co-founded an African Methodist Episcopal (AME) congregation in the city, which enjoyed the support of local white clergy. The church attracted 1,848 members, making it the second-largest AME congregation in the nation.\n\nVesey reportedly began planning the insurrection to take place on Bastille Day, July 14th, 1822, a date notable for its association with the French Revolution, whose victors had abolished slavery in Saint-Domingue.\n\nNews of the plan was said to be spread among thousands of black people throughout Charleston and for tens of miles through plantations along the Carolina coast. Two slaves opposed to Vesey's scheme, George Wilson and Joe LaRoche, gave the first specific testimony about a coming uprising to Charleston officials, saying an uprising was planned for July 14th.\n\nIn June, Vesey was formally accused of being the leader in \"the rising\". He was convicted and quickly executed on July 2nd.\n\nIn the aftermath of Vesey's and others' convictions, authorities blamed \"black religion\" for contributing to the uprising, noting Vesey's role in the AME church.\n\nThe reverend of the church was driven out of the state. Charleston officials ordered the large congregation to be dispersed and the church building to be razed. No black church officially met in Charleston until after the Civil War.",

Aristide was flown out of Haiti by U.S. forces under disputed circumstances - he claims he was kidnapped and did not resign, while the U.S. maintains he entered the plane and resigned willingly.\n\nAristide finally returned to Haiti in 2011, after seven years in exile.\n\n\"If we wish to maintain peace, then we cannot accept that impunity be provided to these international criminals and drug dealers.\"\n\n- Jean-Bertrand Aristide",

While not overtly communist in character, the rebels had burned down a U.S. propaganda outlet and were generally aligned with Gamal Nasser and the United Arab Republic (UAR).\n\nUsing the anti-communist \"Eisenhower Doctrine\" as justification, on July 15th, President Eisenhower authorized \"Operation Blue Bat\", a military occupation of Lebanon with more than 14,000 footsoldiers, supported by a fleet of 70 ships and 40,000 sailors, to keep Chamoun in power.\n\nOccupying the Port of Beirut and Beirut International Airport, the forces remained in Lebanon until October 25th, when President Chamoun completed his term as president of Lebanon.\n\nAccording to historian Maurice Labelle, \"this was the first overt U.S. military intervention in the region\", demonstrating the U.S.'s willingness to act as an imperialist power in the Middle East, willing to commit to overt military action to manage its interests in the region.",

        "description": "On this day in 1964, a New York City cop shot and killed a fifteen year old boy, James Powell, leading to riots across Harlem in which residents protested, clashed with police, and caused approximately $1 million in property damage.\n\nThe rebellion began after Police Lieutenant Thomas Gilligan shot Powell three times in front of his friends and about a dozen other witnesses. Powell had entered the home of Patrick Lynch, a superintendent of three apartment houses in Yorkville, to confront him after he hosed down black students for allegedly hanging out on his building's stoops.\n\nGilligan, then off-duty, shot Powell while he was leaving Lynch's building. Although Gilligan claims Powell lunged at him with a knife, witnesses did not corroborate this account; some stated he raised his right hand in a defensive gesture before being killed.\n\nImmediately after Powell's killing, a group of student protesters clashed with police securing the crime scene. The second day, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) joined the protests.\n\nOn July 18th, the protests became an outright rebellion after Powell's funeral, monitored closely by barricaded police. After the funeral ended and most of the press left, the crowd and cops began to fight. Residents took to the rooftops, throwing bricks, bottles, and mortar at the police below. When one officer shouted \"Go home, go home!\" at the crowd, a reply was heard: \"We are home, Baby.\"\n\nThe unrest lasted until July 22nd, and included a mix of moderate factions from the NAACP as well as black nationalists. When prominent civil rights activist Bayard Rustin tried to discourage rioting, the crowd booed and chanted \"Tom, Uncle Tom\". When an NAACP representative addressed the crowd, stating Bedford-Stuyvesant was a \"community of law\" and discouraging rioting, his van was rocked until he lost control of his microphone.\n\nAt the end of the conflict, reports counted one dead rioter, 118 injured, and 465 arrested. In September, Gilligan was cleared of any wrongdoing by a grand jury and charges were dropped.",

Wells, born on this day in 1862, was a radical journalist and civil rights activist. \"If labor is withdrawn capital will not remain...The white man's dollar is his god, and to stop this will be to stop outrages in many localities.\"\n\nBorn into slavery on July 16th, 1862, Wells was freed by the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. After moving to Memphis, Tennessee, Wells began working as a teacher and wrote for the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight newspaper, which she also co-owned. Her reporting covered incidents of racial injustice.\n\nIn the 1890s, Wells documented lynching in her works \"Horrors\" and \"The Red Record\". Her documentation undermined the white supremacist claim that lynching was something only done to criminals, and her analysis exposed lynching as a means of killing and intimidating black people whose competition was threatening white power.\n\nWells' work was carried nationally in black-owned newspapers, gaining prominence and earning the ire of white supremacists. On May 21st, 1892, Wells published an editorial in the Free Speech refuting what she called \"that old threadbare lie that Negro men rape White women. If Southern men are not careful, a conclusion might be reached which will be very damaging to the moral reputation of their women.\"\n\nFollowing this statement, Wells was denounced as a \"Black scoundrel\" in the press and an angry white mob burned down the Free Speech offices while she was out of town. A group of local white businessmen located Rev. Nightingale, the founder of the Free Speech, assaulted him and forced him at gunpoint to sign a letter retracting Wells' editorial. Wells never returned to Memphis.\n\nWells was also active in the women's suffrage movement, however her unrelenting advocacy for racial justice clashed with contemporary, predominantly white suffrage organizations.\n\nIn 1893, Wells and Frances Willard, President of the white Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), were traveling separately to Britain on lecture tours. Wells publicly criticized Willard for remaining silent on the issue of lynching and blaming black people for a lack of success with her reform campaign in the American South.\n\nIn 1909, Wells co-founded The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) along with figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois and Mary White Ovington.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Wells began writing her autobiography but didn't finish the book before dying of kidney failure in 1931 at age 68. The text was posthumously edited and published by her daughter Alfreda Barnett Duster as \"Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida B. Wells.\"\n\n\"If labor is withdrawn capital will not remain. The Afro-American is thus the backbone of the South. The white man's dollar is his god, and to stop this will be to stop outrages in many localities.\"\n\n- Ida B. Wells",

A few months earlier, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin gave his \"April Theses\", coming out in support of an armed, proletarian insurrection. By July, rank-and-file Bolsheviks were advocating overthrowing the Provisional Government.\n\nOn the morning of July 16th, after a disastrous offensive on World War I's Eastern Front, armed soldiers and workers marched through the streets of Petrograd, to the Tauride Palace. These demonstrators marched under the slogan \"All Power to the Soviets\", firing their rifles into the air and commandeering vehicles.\n\nThe following day at Tauride Palace, the crowd demanded to see a government official, and the Soviet Leaders sent out Viktor Chernov, a prominent member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. When he tried to calm the crowd, they seized him instead, with one protester famously shouting, \"Take power, you son of a bitch, when it is handed to you!\" He was released upon the urging on Leon Trotsky.\n\nThe military authorities sent troops against the demonstrators, leading to many arrests and deaths. The government disarmed workers, disbanded revolutionary military units, destroyed the headquarters of the Bolshevik Central Committee were destroyed, and ordered the arrest of Lenin, Trotsky, and other Bolshevik leaders.\n\nLenin was able to flee to Finland, while Trotsky was arrested alongside Anatoly Lunacharsky and Lev Kamenev. Although the Bolshevik Party's power was temporarily limited in the crackdown, they came to power in the October Revolution just a few months later.",

Garner said \"I can't breathe\" 11 times before dying. The man who filmed his death was poisoned in prison.\n\nEric Garner (1970 - 2014) was a former horticulturist at the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, father of six, and grandfather of three. On July 17th, 2014, was approached by Justin D'Amico, a plainclothes officer, in front of a beauty supply store in Tompkinsville, Staten Island. D'Amico suspected Garner of selling loose cigarettes.\n\nGarner stated \"Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today...I'm minding my business, officer, I'm minding my business. Please just leave me alone. I told you the last time, please just leave me alone.\"\n\nAfter refusing to be handcuffed, 29-year old officer Daniel Pantaleo put Garner in an ultimately fatal chokehold. Despite Garner stating \"I can't breathe\" eleven times before losing consciousness, the several officers on scene did not come to his aid.\n\nRamsey Orta, a member of Copwatch, filmed the incident. Following a campaign of police harassment after the video went viral, he was arrested on weapons charges.\n\nBefore being imprisoned in Rikers, Orta claims a cop told him he'd be better off killing himself before being jailed. While in prison, Orta was poisoned by prison staff and at one point only ate food that his wife brought him. In May 2020, Orta was released from Groveland Correctional Facility.\n\nGarner's death was protested internationally and became one of many police killings protested within the Black Lives Matter movement. Some perpetrators of violence against police have cited Garner's murder as a motive.\n\nA grand jury elected to not indict Pantaleo on December 3rd, 2014. After the decision, Garner's widow was asked whether she accepted Pantaleo's condolences. She replied: \"Hell, no! The time for remorse would have been when my husband was yelling to breathe...No, I don't accept his apology. No, I could care less about his condolences...He's still working. He's still getting a paycheck. He's still feeding his kids, when my husband is six feet under and I'm looking for a way to feed my kids now.\"\n\nAn NYPD disciplinary hearing regarding Pantaleo's treatment of Garner was held in the summer of 2019, and Pantaleo was fired on August 19th, more than five years after the murder took place.",

Most of the dead, injured, and those assigned to clean up the wreckage were enlisted African American sailors.\n\nAccording to historian Erika Doss, \"just a few weeks after the disaster, and with no discussion of why the horrific explosion of July 17th had occurred or how to prevent such a disaster from happening again, the black sailors were ordered back to work loading ordnance at the Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo. Over 250 of the men refused...\" This refusal came to be known as the \"Port Chicago Mutiny\".\n\nFifty men\u200d, known as the \"Port Chicago 50\", \u200cwere convicted of mutiny and sentenced to 15 years of prison and hard labor, as well as a dishonorable discharge. A young Thurgood Marshall undertook a formidable legal campaign, appealing their convictions, and, due to his efforts and popular pressure, the Navy eventually released 47 of the 50 mutineers.\n\nThe incident highlighted racial inequality within the Navy and was one of several incidents that led to it ending its practice of segregation in 1946.",

In 1946, the ANC had also allied with the South African Communist Party in assisting in the formation of the South African Mine Workers' Union.\n\nThe Suppression of Communism Act was protested; more than 20,000 black, Indian, and coloured South Africans gathered in Durban on May 28th, 1950 to protest the bill (shown).\n\nAlthough the act ostensibly banned \"communism\", the law defined communism so broadly that it could effectively be used against anyone who opposed government policy, apartheid in particular. Defendants prosecuted under the law were frequently convicted of \"statutory communism\", something Justice Frans Rumpff, presiding in a trial of ANC leaders, noted has \"nothing to do with communism as it is commonly known.\"\n\nOne notable example of political suppression using this law was the 1956 \"Treason Trial\" in Johannesburg, in which 156 people, including Nelson Mandela, were arrested and accused of treason.\n\nAlthough all defendants of the Treason Trial were found not guilty, Mandela himself, along with figures such as Walter Sisulu and Govan Mbek, was sentenced to life in prison in the Rivonia Trial of 1963.",

        "description": "On this day in 1946, Maceo Snipes, the first black person to vote in Georgia's Taylor County, was shot by white supremacists, dying after doctors refused to give him a blood transfusion due to segregation. The violence outraged a teenage MLK Jr.\n\nSnipes was a World War II veteran who had returned to his hometown of Butler, Georgia. In 1946, a provocative campaign issue was whether or not black people should be allowed to vote in primary elections. Georgia's Jim Crow government had been enforcing whites-only primary elections, but this had been struck down by the Supreme Court earlier that year.\n\nDespite threats from the Ku Klux Klan, Snipes cast his vote in the primary election on July 17th that year, becoming the first black person to vote in Taylor County, according to the Georgia Civil Rights Cold Cases Project. The following day, four white supremacists showed up to Maceo's house, interrupting dinner with his wife, and shot him in the back. The man who shot him, Edward Williamson, was also a World War II veteran.\n\nSnipes was taken to the hospital, where he waited for several hours before the doctors would perform the surgery to remove the bullets. A white doctor told his family that Maceo needed a transfusion, but refused to give him one, citing a lack of \"black blood\" in the hospital. Without a transfusion, Snipes died two days later. Snipes' funeral was held in the middle of the night due to death threats for anyone who dared attend. \n\nIn court, Maceo's killers falsely pleaded self-defense, claiming that Snipes owed them money and attacked them with a knife. Both the coroner and jury determined their actions to be justified. Snipes was one of five black people lynched following the 1946 elections - two couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were kidnapped, beaten, and shot. Mae was seven months pregnant at the time.\n\nThis outbreak of white supremacist violence, and the hypocrisy surrounding it, outraged a teenage Martin Luther King Jr., then a student at Morehouse College. He wrote a letter to the editor of \"The Atlanta Constitution\", stating:\n\n\"I often find when decent treatment for the Negro is urged, a certain class of people hurry to raise the scarecrow of social mingling and intermarriage. These questions have nothing to do with the case. And most people who kick up this kind of dust know that it is simple dust to obscure the real question of rights and opportunities. It is fair to remember that almost the total of race mixture in America has come, not at Negro initiative, but by the acts of those very white men who talk loudest of race purity. We aren\u2019t eager to marry white girls, and we would like to have our own girls left alone by both white toughs and white aristocrats.\"",

He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in an election in which South Africans of all races could participate.\n\nWhile working as a clerk for a law firm as a young man, Mandela befriended two communists - Gaur Radebe, a Hlubi member of the ANC and Communist Party, and Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became his first white friend. Mandela attended Communist Party meetings and, while impressed that people of all races were able to meet as equals, he did not join the party because its atheism conflicted with his own Christianity, and because he saw the South African struggle as being based in race rather than class.\n\nMandela joined the ANC a few years later, quickly rising through its ranks. Although initially committed to non-violent protest, he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the apartheid government.\n\nOn August 5th, 1962, Mandela was captured by South African police, informed by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of his location. In the subsequent legal proceedings, known as the \"Rivonia Trial\", he was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAmid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990 and began negotiating a peaceable end to apartheid with him. In 1994, he became the first legitimately elected President of South Africa.\n\nMandela saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency, and hoped to avoid the damage other post-colonial African economies faced by the departure of white elites.\n\nMandela worked to reassure South Africa's white population that they were protected and represented in the so-called \"the Rainbow Nation\" and embraced liberal reforms, drawing criticism from more his more radical supporters.\n\n\"Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.\"\n\n- Nelson Mandela",

He was assassinated on this day in 1947 by a right-wing nationalist refugee from North Korea.\n\nLyuh was born in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, the son of a local yangban magnate. In 1910, Lyuh parted from Korean tradition by freeing his household's slaves, giving them enough land and money to become self-sufficient.\n\nLike many in the Korean independence movement, Lyuh sought aid from both right and left-wing political movements. In 1920, he joined the Kory\u01d2 Communist Party, later meeting Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin. In 1924, he also joined Sun Yat-sen's Chinese Nationalist Party to facilitate Sino-Korean cooperation.\n\nIn September 1945, Lyuh proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Korea and became its vice-premier. When the United States occupied the Korean Peninsula, it did not recognize the People's Republic of Korea, and in October he was forced to step down under pressure from the U.S. military government.\n\nIn 1946, Lyuh represented the center-left politically as part of an effort to unify right and left-wing independence struggles, however this strategy earned ire from both sides. On July 19th, 1947, Lyuh was assassinated in Seoul by a 19-year-old North Korean refugee who was an active member of a nationalist right-wing organization.\n\nHis pen-name was Mongyang, the Hanja for \"dream\" and \"the sun\".",

Striking workers refused to cede control of the trains to the company, and by midnight up to 1,400 strikers had gathered in the Pennsylvania Railroad rail yards, stopping the movement of some 1,500 cars.\n\nBy the morning of the 21st, it had become clear that many of the Pittsburgh police and local militia had sided with the strikers and were refusing to take action against them.\n\nThe Pennsylvania National Guard were sent in to forcibly quell the rebellion, and the protest turned into a riot after troops shot into a crowd of people for ten minutes, killing women and children. Rioters began looting, setting fire to the train cars and the Union Depot (shown).

People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) agents also assassinated anti-Soviet leftists in the movement, figures like founder of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) Andreu Nin.

He had previously been convicted for disseminating \"false news\" in cases involving the head of the national police, although the sentence was suspended.\n\nEl Mahdaoui was part of a political group that had been organizing anti-government protests since October 2016 over perceived government neglect of northern Morocco's Rif region.\n\nThe government had banned a protest planned for July 20th, 2017, and on July 19th, El Mahdaoui publicly condemned the ban. El Mahdaoui was arrested and, along with 53 other Hirak activists, forced to participate in a mass trial lasting almost one year.\n\nOn July 20th, 2020, El Mahdaoui was released from prison, returning to his family. His website, badil.info, remains active.",

        "description": "Frantz Fanon, born on this day in 1925, was a West Indian Pan-Africanist philosopher and Algerian revolutionary most known for his text The Wretched of the Earth.\n\nFanon was born to an affluent family on the Caribbean island of Martinique, then a French colony which is still under French control today. As a teenager, he was taught by communist anti-colonial thinker Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire (1913 - 2008).\n\nFanon was exposed to much European racism during World War II. After France fell to the Nazis in 1940, a Nazi government was set up in Martinique by French collaborators, who he described as taking off their masks and behaving like \"authentic racists\".\n\nFighting for the Allied forces, Fanon also observed European women liberated by black soldiers preferring to dance with fascist Italian prisoners rather than fraternize with their liberators.\n\nWhile completing a residency in psychiatry in France completing, Fanon wrote and published his first book, \"Black Skin, White Masks\" (1952), an analysis of the negative psychological effects of colonial subjugation upon black people.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Algerian revolution in November 1954, Fanon joined the Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale, a nationalist Algerian party. Working at a French hospital in Algeria, Fanon became responsible for treating the psychological distress of the French troops who carried out torture to suppress anti-colonial resistance, as well as their Algerian victims.\n\nWhile organizing for Algerian independence in Ghana, Fanon was diagnosed with the leukemia that would ultimately kill him. He spent the last year of his life writing his most famous work, \"The Wretched of the Earth\" (French: Les Damn\u00e9s de la Terre). The text provides a psychiatric analysis of the dehumanizing effects of colonization and examines the possibilities of anti-colonial liberation.\n\nFollowing a trip to the Soviet Union to treat his leukemia, Fanon came to the U.S. in 1961 for further treatment in a visit arranged by the CIA. Fanon died in Bethesda, Maryland on December 6th, 1961 under the name of \"Ibrahim Fanon\", a Libyan nom de guerre he had assumed in order to enter a hospital after being wounded during a mission for the Algerian National Liberation Front.\n\n\"In the World through which I travel, I am endlessly creating myself.\"\n\n- Frantz Fanon",

The boys organized under charismatic child leaders, meeting with the paper owners and holding meetings as large as 5,000 people.\n\nThe boys also rioted and used direct action: upon declaring the strike, they turned over a distribution wagon for the New York Journal, and any boy or adult caught hocking either paper would be attacked by a mob of striking children, who would seize and destroy the papers they were selling.\n\nIn the end, wholesale price remained at 60 cents, however the newspaper owners agreed to begin refunding boys for unsold papers.\n\n\"Ain't that ten cents worth as much to us as it is to Hearst and Pulitzer who are millionaires? Well, I guess it is. If they can't spare it, how can we?...I'm trying to figure out how ten cents on a hundred papers can mean more to a millionaire than it does to newsboys, an' I can't see it.\"\n\n- Kid Blink, 1899",

        "description": "On this day in 2001, Italian police raided a school occupied by anti-globalization protesters and journalists, beating and torturing hundreds of protesters. No officer served time in prison.\n\nThe school was the temporary headquarters of the anti-capitalist Genoa Social Forum, led by Vittorio Agnoletto, set up during the 27th G8 meeting in Genoa. A nearby building, housing the anti-globalization organization Indymedia and lawyers affiliated with the Genoa Social Forum, was also raided.\n\nOn July 21st, just before midnight, Italian cops raided the school, brutally beating and torturing all present. The police officers fabricated evidence of weapons and assault to justify their brutality, planting molotov cocktails and slashing their own bulletproof vests to justify the violence.\n\nBefore officers entered the school, British journalist Mark Covell confronted them outside, attempting to tell them he was a journalist. Several officers responded by beating him into a coma, breaking his hand, damaging his spine, and breaking six of his ribs. The police then used an armored police van to break through the school gates and 150 policemen, wearing crash helmets and carrying truncheons and shields, entered the school compound.\n\nPolice beat and tortured everyone they found. Several people were beaten unconscious, sexually harassed, had hair cut from their head, and thrown down the stairs. At least one person needed surgery to stop a bleed in their brain.\n\nSome arrested were taken back to a temporary detention facility in Bolzaneto. There, they were tortured and forced to praise fascists such as Mussolini and Pinochet in song. One man testified that, after he refused to sign fabricated statements about what happened, police broke three of his ribs.\n\nAlthough fifteen Italian police officers and doctors were sentenced to jail for the mistreatment of the detainees at Bolzaneto, none served time in prison due to a statute of limitations on their crimes. The British government supported the Italian government in the violence's aftermath; the spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair stated \"The Italian police had a difficult job to do. The prime minister believes that they did that job.\"",

The work stoppage affected many of Dublin's most famous hotels, while hospital laundries were exempted from the action.\n\nThe strike enjoyed considerable support from the public and other unions. The National Secretary of the United Stationary Engine Drivers stated \"We will support your union in every possible way; the people on strike are fighting our fight\", and butchers helped fund relief efforts as the strike wore on for months.\n\nThe press was less sympathetic. In a letter to The Irish Times, the IWWU criticized its reporting:\n\n\"We read your paper sometimes pasted up in those Fleet Street windows, and we see it full of news about foreign countries and pictures of people no-one ever saw in Dublin...And you had nearly a page of a letter from New York telling how the girls there do their hair. But for all that you only have two lines or so for 1,500 Dublin women on strike and no word at all about the sort of work they had to do.\"\n\nThe strike was won at the end of October.",

Their arrest prompted a wave of labor activism that culminated in a general strike in which 250,000 workers participated.\n\nAs part of the work stoppage, thousands of striking workers marched through North London to Pentonville Prison. The Five were released on Wednesday, July 26th, however the labor activism provoked by their arrests continued unabated.\n\nThe radical film group Cinema Action made a documentary about the event titled \"Arise Ye Workers\", released in 1973.",

The strike eventually grew to including nearly 5,000 postal workers nationwide, becoming the largest strike of U.S. federal employees between 1970 and 1981.\n\nThe previous contract, which set the terms of employment for U.S. postal workers, had just expired at midnight on July 20th. Postal management, the national union leadership, and the Carter Administration, had created a new collective agreement which ignored most rank and file postal workers' concerns.\n\nIn Jersey City, New Jersey, workers at the Bulk and Foreign Mail Center formed the Good Contract Committee (GCC) to organize a set of demands for the new contract that reflected the interests of the working class. These activists launched a newspaper called P.O.W. (Post Office Worker) and distributed 75,000 leaflets at local postal facilities.\n\nThe Bulk Jersey City wildcat strike lasted for four days in an attempt to nullify the tentative national contract agreement. It shut down the NJ plant as well as another bulk center in Richmond, California.\n\nAfter the strike was broken, 125 workers were fired, 130 were temporarily suspended, 2,500 received letters of warning, and leaders of the walkout were blacklisted. The union did not ratify the proposed work contract, and an arbitrated contract settlement was imposed.",

Once their race became known, the ABA rescinded all three memberships, prompting national outrage and resignations in protest. Despite this, the ABA did not re-instate the men and continued their discriminatory practices for several decades afterward.\n\nWilson, who was still a member of the Massachusetts State Bar, would go on to fight racial discrimination in legal arenas for the next several decades.

The Long, Hot Summer of 1967 refers to just a few short months in which more than a hundred riots took place across the United States.\n\nIn the early hours of July 23rd, Detroit Police Department (DPD) officers raided an unlicensed weekend drinking club in the office of the United Community League for Civic Action. Expecting a few revelers inside, they instead found a party of 82 people celebrating the return of two local GIs from the Vietnam War. The police decided to arrest everyone present.\n\nAfter the DPD left, a crowd of onlookers began looting an adjacent clothing store. Shortly thereafter, full-scale looting began throughout the neighborhood. This looting escalated into a city-wide uprising that involved shootouts between rioters and police officers.\n\nThe violence escalated throughout the next day, resulting in some 483 fires and 1,800 arrests. Thousands of guns were stolen from stores. Firefighters attempting to put out fires were shot at, police brutality was rampant. Even when thousands of federal troops were sent to occupy Detroit, the rioting could not be quelled until July 28th.\n\n43 people were killed in total, most of whom were black. Among the dead was a four year old girl named Tanya Blanding, shot and killed by Sgt. Mortimer J. LeBlanc after he fired indiscriminately into her mother's apartment. LeBlanc was exonerated by the state.\n\nThe scale of the riot was the worst in the United States since the 1863 New York City draft riots during the American Civil War and was not surpassed until the 1992 Los Angeles riots 25 years later.",

        "description": "On this day in 1877, as part of the Great Railroad Strike, a general strike broke out in Scranton, Pennsylvania when railroad workers walked off the job, quickly joined by thousands more from a variety of industries.\n\nThe strike began on July 23rd when railroad workers walked off the job in protest of recent wage cuts, a strike that continued into mid-November. By July 26th, it grew to include thousands of workers from a variety of industries, including brakemen, firemen, mill workers, and miners.\n\nViolence erupted on August 1st after thousands of angry strikers rioted, looting stores, assaulting the mayor, and clashing with a local pro-business militia. The militia shot into the crowd (depicted above), leaving four dead and many more wounded.\n\nThe next day, National Guard arrived to Scranton and imposed martial law, later aided by federal troops. Comparatively minor acts of violence continued throughout the strike and associated riots. The occupying military forces left the area at the end of October, signaling an end to the uprising.",

By 1936, he was head of the Cuban Communist Party and began serving as a politican, helping author the 1940 Cuban Constitution.\n\nUnder Roca's leadership, Cuban communists were instrumental in providing an organizational and ideological structure for Castro's revolution, as well as playing a pivotal role using the party's long-standing ties with the Soviet Union to promote increasingly closer ties during the early days of the revolution.\n\nIn 1961, Blas Roca, leading a party delegation, presented a Cuban flag to Nikita Khrushchev during a meeting of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Roca served on the first central committee and politburo of the new Communist Party of Cuba, founded in 1965.",

As a young man, he sympathized with the 1848 revolutions throughout Europe.\n\nFrom 1851 to 1853, he taught Russian language and literature at the Saratov Gymnasium and openly expressed his beliefs to students, some of whom later became revolutionaries.\n\nIn 1862, he was arrested and confined in the Fortress of St. Peter and Paul, where he wrote his widely influential novel \"What Is to Be Done?\" The novel was an inspiration to many later Russian revolutionaries, who sought to emulate the novel's hero Rakhmetov, who was wholly dedicated to the revolution, ascetic in his habits, and highly disciplined.\n\nFyodor Dostoyevsky was so bothered by the political and psychological ideas expressed in the book that he wrote his \"Notes from Underground\" as a critical reaction against them.\n\nChernyshevsky was a dominant intellectual figure of the 1860s revolutionary democratic movement in Russia despite spending much of his later life in exile to Siberia, and was later praised by figures such as Karl Marx, Georgi Plekhanov, and Vladimir Lenin.\n\n\"But does it really help if a person doesn't realize what he lacks, or, if he does, he insists that he doesn't need it at all? That's an illusion, a fantasy. Human nature is stifled by reason, circumstances, and pride. It keeps silent and doesn't make itself known to one's consciousness, all the while silently doing its work of undermining life.\"\n\n- Nikolay Chernyshevsky",

        "description": "Emmett Till, born on this day in 1941, was a black child tortured and lynched by white supremacists in Mississippi at 14 years old. His killers sold the story of how they murdered him for $4,000 after being acquitted by an all-white jury.\n\nEmmett was born in Chicago to Mamie Carthan, a working class woman from Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, where the average annual income for a black family was $462 (equivalent to $4,700 in 2016 dollars). In 1955, Till's great-uncle visited the family in Chicago and told Emmett stories about the Mississippi Delta, leading Emmett to plan a visit.\n\nTill arrived in Money, Mississippi, on August 21st, 1955. On the 24th, Till and his friends visited a store owned by a white couple. Till was accused of whistling at and approaching the wife, Carolyn Bryant, while at the store.\n\nFacts of Till's interaction with Bryant are disputed, however many of the accusations - that Till put his hands on Bryant, that he made lewd comments at her, or that he bragged to his friends about having had sex with a white woman - have been withdrawn by the people who initially made them. Till's mother has also stated that she taught Emmett to whistle to help with his stutter, which he developed after a bout with polio.\n\nAfter word broke out that an interaction had taken place between Till and Bryant, Carolyn's husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, J.W. Milam abducted Emmett, tortured him, shot him, and threw his corpse into the Tallahatchie River. Following Till's disappearance, civil rights activists Medgar Evers and Amzie Moore went undercover as cotton pickers to try and locate him.\n\nThree days after his abduction and murder, Till's swollen and disfigured body was found by two boys who were fishing in the Tallahatchie River. His head was very badly mutilated, he had been shot above the right ear, an eye was dislodged from the socket, there was evidence that he had been beaten on the back and the hips, and his body weighted by a fan blade, which was fastened around his neck with barbed wire.\n\nMamie decided to have an open-casket funeral, saying: \"There was just no way I could describe what was in that box. No way. And I just wanted the world to see.\" Tens of thousands of people lined the street outside the mortuary to view Till's body, and days later thousands more attended his funeral at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ.\n\nIn the lead-up to Bryant and Milam's trial, local newspapers falsely reported that there were riots at Till's funeral, and depicted both men smiling in military uniforms. On September 23rd, 1955, an all-white, all-male jury (both women and blacks had been explicitly banned) acquitted Bryant and Milam after a 67-minute deliberation. One juror said \"If we hadn't stopped to drink pop, it wouldn't have taken that long.\"\n\nProtected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam quickly struck a deal with \"Look\" magazine in 1956 to tell their story for approximately $4,000 ($35,000 in 2016 dollars).\n\nEmmett Till's murder became a flashpoint in the American civil rights movement; the Montgomery Bus Boycott began in December later that year after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white person. Parks stated \"I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back.\"\n\nMyrlie Evers, the widow of Medgar Evers, said in 1985 that Till's case resonated so strongly because it \"shook the foundations of Mississippi - both black and white, because...with the white community...it had become nationally publicized...with us as blacks...it said, even a child was not safe from racism and bigotry and death.\"",

Lasting from 1932 until 1972, all of its participants were poor, rural black men with very limited access to health information.\n\nIn November 1966, Buxtun had filed an official protest on ethical grounds with the PHS's \"Division of Venereal Diseases\" and another protest in November 1968, however his concerns were dismissed both times. In 1968, black statistician and PHS employee William Carter Jenkins also called for an end to the study in his magazine The Drum.\n\nIt wasn't until Buxtun leaked the story to the Washington Star that the study became public knowledge and a national scandal. In 1974, as part of the settlement of a class action lawsuit filed by the NAACP on behalf of study participants and their descendants, the U.S. government paid $10 million ($51.8 million in 2019) and agreed to provide free medical treatment to surviving participants and surviving family members infected as a consequence of the study.\n\nThe Tuskegee Experiments were not the only syphilis experiments performed by the U.S. government against non-white people - from 1946 to 1948, the U.S. conducted a similar study in Guatemala in which doctors infected soldiers, prostitutes, prisoners and mental patients with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, without the informed consent of the subjects, leading to at least 83 deaths.\n\nThe Guatemalan experiments were led by physician John Charles Cutler, who also participated in the late stages of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. Cutler never faced criminal charges for his actions.",

When the Bolsheviks consolidated power following the Russian Civil War, Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders instituted a ban on factions in the party during the 10th Party Congress of 1921.\n\nThe concept was widely influential in other communist movements; for example, it was adopted in Article 3 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.\n\nLibertarian socialists have been critical of the practice, with anarchist writer Scott Nappolas calling democratic centralism \"the organizational theory of a rising ruling class\".",

        "description": "On this day in 1957, anti-communist Guatemalan leader Carlos Castillo Armas was assassinated by a leftist member of the Presidential Guard, causing instability that led to the Guatemalan Civil War, killing ~200,000 civilians.\n\nArmas had seized power with the aid of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a 1954 coup against democratically elected leader Jacobo \u00c1rbenz, ending an almost ten year period of representative democracy in the country.\n\n\u00c1rbenz was a social reformer whose government had instituted, among many other reforms, land redistribution, earning the ire of the United Fruit Company (UFCO) and the U.S. government.\n\nAfter Armas consolidated his power in an October 1954 election in which he was the only candidate, \u00c1rbenz's popular agricultural reform was largely rolled back, with land confiscated from small farmers and returned to large landowners.\n\nHe also created a National Committee of Defense Against Communism, which investigated over 70,000 people and added 10% of the population to a list of suspected communists. Armas cracked down on unions and peasant organizations, arresting and killing thousands, often justifying the repression in the name of anti-communism.\n\nOn July 26th, 1957, Armas was assassinated by Romeo V\u00e1squez S\u00e1nchez, a member of the presidential guard. After killing Armas, S\u00e1nchez fled into a different room and committed suicide.\n\nFollowing Armas's death, a period of violent political instability followed, with the U.S. backing state forces while leftist insurgents waged guerilla warfare against the state during the Guatemalan Civil War (1960 - 1996).\n\nThe Civil War killed more than 200,000 civilians. Though crimes against civilians were committed by both sides, 93% of these atrocities were committed by the U.S.-backed military, including a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population during the 1980s. Historians have attributed the violence of the civil war to the 1954 coup and the \"anti-communist paranoia\" that it generated.",

History will absolve me.\" Both Fidel and Ra\u00fal were later released as a part of general amnesty for political prisoners.\n\nThe surviving revolutionaries fled to Mexico and began organizing to overthrow the Batista government. Several years later, they succeeded, finally ousting Batista on December 31st, 1958, replacing his government with a revolutionary socialist state. Castro's 26th of July Movement later reformed along Marxist-Leninist lines, becoming the Communist Party in October of 1965.\n\nThe Cuban Revolution had powerful domestic and international repercussions. In particular, it made Cuba's relationship with the United States, which had been dominating the island's economy since 1901, significantly more antagonistic.\n\nImmediately following the revolution, Castro's government initiated sweeping nationalization and social welfare campaigns, transforming Cuba's economy and civil society. Castro's government also highly prioritized international aid, providing more medical personnel to the developing world than all the G8 countries combined, according to authors Robert Huish and John M. Kirk.\n\nToday is celebrated in Cuba as the Day of the Revolution (\"Dia de la Revoluci\u00f3n\").",

The Communist International immediately reinforced its activity sending to Spain its leader Georgi Dimitrov, as well as Palmiro Togliti, the chief of the Communist Party of Italy.\n\nFrom August onward, aid was sent from Russia: more than one ship a day arrived at Spain's Mediterranean ports carrying munitions, rifles, machine guns, hand grenades, artillery, trucks, and Soviet agents and technicians.\n\nThe conference led to the formation of international brigades of volunteer forces, including the American Lincoln Battalion (shown). Similar groups included the George Washington Battalion and the John Brown Battery (both American), while Latin American and Irish troops formed the Centuria Guttieras and the Connolly Column, respectively.\n\nAlthough the politics of the Lincoln Battalion skewed to the left, the one unifying trait of those who joined was a hatred for fascism. They were also inexperienced and not well trained, suffering heavy casualties during the war.\n\nAmerican Canute Frankson explained his decision to join in a letter written on July 6th, 1937:\n\n\"I'm sure that by this time you are still waiting for a detailed explanation of what has this international struggle to do with my being here. Since this is a war between whites who for centuries have held us in slavery, and have heaped every kind of insult and abuse upon us, segregated and Jim-Crowed us; why I, a Negro who have fought through these years for the rights of my people, am here in Spain today?\n\n...Because if we crush Fascism here we'll save our people in America, and in other parts of the world from the vicious persecution, wholesale imprisonment, and slaughter which the Jewish people suffered and are suffering under Hitler's Fascist heels.\n\n...We will build us a new society - a society of peace and plenty. There will be no color line, no jim-crow trains, no lynching. That is why, my dear, I\u2019m here in Spain.\"",

The government declared a state of war and put down the rebellion with the Army, killing more than 100 civilians. The series of clashes between working class radicals and government forces is known as the \"Tragic Week\".\n\nThe uprising's immediate cause was Premier Antonio Maura attempting to bring out reserve troops as reinforcements to bolster Spanish military-colonial activity in Morocco. Many of these reservists were the only breadwinners for their families, while the wealthy were able to hire substitutes.\n\nThese actions, coupled with anarchist, anti-militarist, and anti-colonial philosophies shared by many in the city, resulted in the calling of a general strike against Maura's attempt at conscription. By the next day, workers had occupied much of central Barcelona, halting troop trains and overturning trams. Just a few days later, there was street fighting, with a general eruption of riots, strikes, and the burning of convents.\n\nThe Spanish government declared a \"state of war\" and used the national army to put down the rebellion by force. Over one hundred civilians were killed and more than 1,700 individuals were indicted in military courts for \"armed rebellion\".",

Following the strike, he was blacklisted and was forced to move away from Cumberland to find work.\n\nIn 1916, he joined the Mining and Smelter workers Union and was elected as Secretary for the Trail chapter. Following his involvement with trade unions, Goodwin entered politics running as a candidate for the Socialist Party of Canada in the 1916 British Columbian election, although he did not win.\n\nAs World War I broke out, Goodwin became an outspoken advocate against the draft, initially refusing to sign up. Eventually, he was compelled to be drafted, and, after exhausting multiple appeals against his conscription, he fled into the hills of Cumberland, British Columbia.\n\nOn July 27th (some sources say July 26th), Goodwin was shot and killed by a member of the Dominion Police, who had ventured into the hills surrounding Comox Lake to locate men evading the draft and arrest them for their evasion. The officer who killed Goodwin successfully claimed self-defense in court, although it is unknown how the two actually encountered each other.\n\nIn protest to his murder, the first general strike in Canada, the Vancouver General Strike, took place on August 2nd, 1918. In 2015, a film about his life titled \"Goodwin's Way\" was released.\n\n\"War is simply part of the process of Capitalism. Big financial interests are playing the game. They'll reap the victory, no matter how the war ends.\"\n\n- Albert Goodwin",

Also at the Fort were Creek and Choctaw allies who had served alongside the British during the war.\n\nAs Nicolls hoped, the fort, near the Southern border of the United States, became a center and symbol of resistance to American slavery. The \"Negro Fort\" was the largest instance before the American Civil War in which fugitive slaves took up arms against the U.S. government that sought to enslave them.\n\nOn July 27th, American forces acting on orders from General Andrew Jackson committed to an all-out attack against the fort. From a boat on the river, the American forces used red-hot shot, trying to start a fire. A shot landed in the powder magazine, which ignited, blowing up the fort and killing over 270 people instantly.\n\nCaptured black survivors were re-enslaved in Georgia. The largest group of survivors took refuge further south, in Angola, Florida. Others founded Nicholls Town in the Bahamas.\n\nSecretary of State John Quincy Adams later justified the attack and subsequent seizure of Spanish Florida by Andrew Jackson as national \"self-defense\". Seminole anger at the U.S. for the fort's destruction contributed to the breakout of the First Seminole War a year later.",

For two years prior to this campaign there was a militant struggle to oust him which included gun battles, bombings, and political assassinations.\n\nTwo days after Havana bus drivers went on strike, they were joined by inter-city drivers who struck in solidarity. Soldiers fired on demonstrators in Havana on August 1st, killing two, and, on the same day in Santa Clara, shops and theaters closed.\n\nWhen police attacked a group of striking teachers, more transportation workers went on strike, soon joined by workers from a variety of industries. By early August, railway workers, hotel and restaurant workers, physicians, bakers, cigarmakers, and state utility workers were all striking in protest of the state.\n\nWhen an underground radio station controlled by an anti-Machado resistance group falsely claimed that Machado had resigned and called for a huge public demonstration, a mob marched on the Presidential Palace.\n\nPolice began to fire on the crowd before the marchers could reach the palace, killing twenty protesters. Seeing the public support against Machado, the military decided to switch sides, placing Havana under military control on August 9th. Machado resigned and fled the country two days later.",

By that evening, the inmates had seized the hospital and set the prison on fire.\n\nPrisoners released the hostages 24 hours after the uprising began, but retained control of the facility until August 4th. When the riot was over, three inmates had been killed and more than $20 million in damage had been done to twenty-four buildings. Despite the violence, conditions at the prison were not sufficiently improved to prevent more riots - another riot occurred at the Oklahoma State Prison in December 1985.",

        "description": "On this day in 1932, Washington D.C. police and the U.S. Army battled with WWI veterans camped out at the capitol who were demanding early payment of their service bonus, killing three people and wounding fifty-five more.\n\nThe so-called \"Bonus Army\" was a group of 43,000 demonstrators, made up of 17,000 U.S. World War I veterans, together with their families and affiliated groups, who gathered in Washington, D.C. in mid-1932 to demand early cash redemption of their service certificates.\n\nMost of the Bonus Army camped in a \"Hooverville\" on the Anacostia Flats, a swampy, muddy area across the Anacostia River from the federal core of Washington (now Section C of Anacostia Park). Approximately 10,000 veterans, women and children lived in the shelters, built from materials dragged out of a junk pile nearby, including old lumber, packing boxes, and scrap tin, which covered roofs of thatched straw.\n\nOn this day in 1932, President Hoover ordered the Secretary of War to disperse the protesters. When the veterans returned after being pushed out the first time, police fired on them, killing two. Federal troops were called in and, armed with bayonets and tear gas, they moved to evict the Bonus Army by force.\n\nIn the mayhem that followed, 55 veterans were injured, 135 were arrested, and one three month old baby died. The incident was politically disastrous for President Hoover, who lost the election that year to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1933, another Bonus Army marched on Washington D.C., but FDR, perhaps learning from his predecessor's mistakes, created a camp for the soldiers and fed them. He offered the veterans jobs with the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and those who chose not to work for the CCC were given transportation home.",

        "description": "Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, born on this day in 1954, was a socialist leader of Venezuela, serving as the country's President from 1999 - 2013. During that period, Ch\u00e1vez's government abolished illiteracy and codified healthcare as a human right.\n\nCh\u00e1vez was born to schoolteachers in the rural village of Sabaneta. While serving in the Venezuelan military as a young man, Ch\u00e1vez began reading Marxist literature which had been left behind by leftist insurgents his unit had been tasked with dispatching. By age 21, he came to recognize the need for a leftist government in Venezuela.\n\nIn 1982, while still active in the military, Ch\u00e1vez founded the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (EBR-200), inspired by Latin American revolutionaries Ezequiel Zamora, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, and Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez.\n\nIn 1992, EBR-200 attempted a coup to oust President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez, who had reneged on campaign promises and begun instituting economic policies of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The coup attempt failed, killing fourteen people. Although Ch\u00e1vez was imprisoned, this incident helped him become a symbol of anti-corruption for working class Venezuelans.\n\nIn 1994, Ch\u00e1vez was pardoned by President Rafael Caldera and went on a 100-day speaking tour, promoting the Bolivarian cause of social revolution. He visited Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, and Cuba, befriending Fidel Castro.\n\nIn 1998, Ch\u00e1vez won an election for the Venezuelan Presidency with 56% of the vote, promising widespread social and economic reforms. He would go on to serve as President from 1999 until his death from cancer in 2013 at age 58.\n\nIn 2002, Ch\u00e1vez fired executives of the state-run oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Following violent protests between anti- and pro- government forces, the Venezuelan military attempted a coup, kidnapping Ch\u00e1vez. This was met with a massive pro-Ch\u00e1vez uprising from the public, and he was re-instated to power after just 47 hours.\n\nCh\u00e1vez's government succeeded in abolishing illiteracy, expanding access to social services such as healthcare and education, and established rights that protected indigenous cultural practices.\n\nCh\u00e1vez was subjected to particularly vehement criticism from liberal institutions and intellectuals. British Trotskyist Alan Woods wrote that the \"media campaign of vilification against Ch\u00e1vez had no precedent in modern history\". Some of this criticism comes from institutions such as the \"Freedom House\", a majority U.S. government funded think tank based out of Washington D.C., and \"Bloomberg\", a newspaper named after and majority controlled by American oligarch Michael Bloomberg.\n\n\"The capitalist model, the developed model, the consumer model which comes from the North, which it has forced on the world, is falling apart on Earth, and there is no planet nearby that we can emigrate to.\"\n\n- Hugo Ch\u00e1vez",

Burns was a prodigious student who studied at the universities of Yale and Columbia in the United States, Oxford in the United Kingdom, and Bonn and Berlin in Germany.\n\nBurns became involved in suffragette activism while traveling in Britain, becoming employed by and organizing with the Women's Social and Political Union.\n\nWorking with her friend Alice Paul, Burns engaged in multiple acts of rebellion while in Britain, getting arrested and force-fed when attempting to hunger strike. When Burns refused to open her mouth, the feeding tube was inserted up her nostril, causing severe nosebleeds.\n\nOne incident involving Burns and Paul that led to such treatment was crashing the London Lord Mayor's Ball, mingling with guests before approaching Winston Churchill with a hidden banner shouting \"How can you dine here while women are starving in prison?\"\n\nBurns and other suffrage activists in the U.S. successfully got Congress to vote on a women's suffrage amendment in 1918, however it narrowly failed in the Senate. It was later passed and officially ratified on August 18th, 1920.\n\nAfter achieving this goal, Burns stated \"I don't want to do anything more. I think we have done all this for women, and we have sacrificed everything we possessed for them, and now let them fight for it now. I am not going to fight anymore\" and retired from public life.",

The Panthers used this to their advantage when \"copwatching\" in their communities - armed Panthers would patrol the neighborhood and swarm on scene to arrests shortly after they began, informing the arrestee of their constitutional rights.\n\nThe Mulford Act, dubbed the \"Panther Bill\" by the media, enjoyed bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats. Before the law was passed, armed Panthers occupied the California capitol building to protest it on May 2nd (shown).

The imperialist occupation lasted until 1934.\n\nHaiti had already been suffering from U.S. imperialism and political turmoil prior to the invasion. In 1914, U.S. Marines stole $500,000 in gold from the country's National Bank. Haiti's leader, President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam, had also recently been killed by insurgents angered by state-sanctioned murders of his political opposition.\n\nPresident Wilson ordered the invasion to \"protect American and foreign\" interests and also wanted to rewrite the Haitian constitution, which banned foreign ownership of land, and replace it with one that guaranteed American financial control. To avoid public criticism, Wilson claimed the occupation was a mission to \"re-establish peace and order...and has nothing to do with any diplomatic negotiations of the past or the future\".\n\nWhen the Haitian legislature refused to ratify a new constitution that allowed foreigners to own land there, the U.S.-backed President Dartiguenave dissolved the legislature and the constitution became law. U.S. occupiers also re-instituted a system of slavery known as civil conscription (\"impressed labor\"), in which Haitian civilians were captured and forced to work on public projects and established the National Guard.\n\nThe U.S. military occupation of Haiti continued until August 15th, 1934. According to the U.S. State Department's Office of the Historian, the invasion's result was this: \"The United States gained complete control over Haitian finances, and the right to intervene in Haiti whenever the U.S. Government deemed necessary.\"",

Despite having stated \"Phelps Dodge has the worst record in labor relations of any company that has ever operated in Arizona\", Babbitt sent 750 National Guard and state police officers to the area to protect business operations.\n\nAfter a crowd of 1,000 armed protesters shut down the copper plant on threat of violence, ten strikers were arrested in Ajo and charged with rioting, further weakening the strike. The strike officially ended on February 19th, 1986, when the National Labor Relations Board rejected appeals from the unions attempting to halt decertification.",

In 1988, a film based on her life was released - \"Story of Women\".\n\nGiraud was born on July 30th, 1903 to a poor family and settled in the port city of Cherbourg. She cleaned houses and worked as a laundress to support her family.\n\nIn 1939, the French government increased the criminal penalties for abortion, as World War II had caused a significant decline in the birth rate. Along these lines, the Vichy Regime (formed in 1940) created propaganda posters stating \"The Family is the Foundation of Society\".\n\nWhen the Nazis occupied Cherbourg in June 1940, there was an influx of prostitutes to the area and Giraud rented rooms out to them. She performed abortions on 27 women, including one who died in January 1942. An anonymous letter detailing Giraud's activities written in October 1942 led to her arrest.\n\nSuch was the prominence of Giraud's trial that the head of the Vichy Regime, Philippe P\u00e9tain, called her an immoral woman himself She was guillotined on July 30th, 1943, the last woman to be executed by the Nazi French government.\n\nGiraud's story was dramatized in the 1988 film Story of Women, directed by Claude Chabrol. The film premiered at the 45th Venice International Film Festival, in which Isabelle Huppert was awarded the prize for best actress.",

As a delegation of 130 black New Orleans residents marched behind the U.S. flag toward the Mechanics Institute, Mayor John T. Monroe (who had supported the Confederacy) organized and led a mob of ex-Confederates and members of the New Orleans Police force to the Institute to block their way.\n\nOnce the marchers reached the Institute, the police and white mob members attacked them, beating some of the marchers while others rushed inside the building for safety. As the firing continued, some delegates attempted to flee or surrender.\n\nSome of those who surrendered, mostly black people, were killed on the spot. Those who ran were chased, and the killing spread over several blocks around the Institute. Altogether, 238 people were killed and 46 were wounded, including 200 black Union veterans.",

Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans and become dictator.\n\nAlthough the accused individuals denied the existence of a plot, a final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's testimony.\n\nToday, Butler is most remembered for his text \"War is a Racket\" and associated anti-imperialist speeches in which he vehemently condemned U.S. military actions. Of his service, he wrote the following:\n\n\"I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps...And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.\"",

German repression killed 250,000-300,000 people.\n\nThe Maji Maji Rebellion (Swahili: \"Vita vya Maji Maji\"), was an armed rebellion of Islamic and Animist Africans against German colonial rule, triggered by a colonial policy designed to force the indigenous population to grow cotton for export.\n\nIn the days leading up to the rebellion, a spirit medium named Kinjikitile Ngwale developed a belief that the people of German East Africa had been called upon to eliminate the Germans. After the Matumbi tribesmen attacked Samanga, Kinjikitile was arrested. Before being executed, he stated that he had already spread the \"medicine of rebellion\" throughout the region.\n\nThe resulting war lasted two years, with the Germans successfully putting the rebellion down by force. As a means to weaken the rebellion, German soldiers deliberately orchestrated a famine by destroying available food sources, devastating the region and killing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nSuch was the scale of this destruction that, in 1953, journalist John Gunther noted \"even today the Southern Province of Tanganyika, the 'Cinderella Province,' has not fully recovered from the German terror half a century ago. The economy of the region has never been successfully rebuilt\".\n\nAlthough Tanzania demanded reparations from Germany for these atrocities in 2017, the German government has not paid them as of July 2021.",

On August 12th, workers formed a lynch mob and rioted in the nation's capital, terrorizing the free black community there for days, until President Andrew Jackson ended the race riot by force.\n\nIn what is now known as the \"Snow Riot\", white workers attacked establishments run by free black people, such as schools, churches, and businesses. The riot caused public support for the strike to wane, and the black community received no compensation and little public sympathy for the violence they suffered.\n\nFive years later, in 1840, all public workers finally received a ten hour day by order of President Martin Van Buren.",

On June 17th, 1932, at twenty-four years old, he was put in front of the firing squad at the Bretta Fort. He refused last rites from a priest.

Little was an American labor leader and organizer with the IWW who, on this day in 1917, was sprung from jail and lynched in Butte, Montana. 10,000 workers lined the route of his funeral procession.\n\nIn the months before Little's death, he had been helping organize copper workers in a strike against the Anaconda Copper Company and speaking out against World War I, calling it a \"rich man's war and a poor man's fight\".\n\nIn the early hours of August 1st, six masked men broke into the boardinghouse where Little was staying and beat, kidnapped, and lynched him by tying him to the back of a speeding car. No one was apprehended for his murder, although IWW members alleged members of the local police were involved, noting that Butte's chief of detectives, Ed Morrissey, took a three week leave of absence after Little's death.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 workers lined the route of Frank Little's funeral procession, which was followed by 3,500 more people. His funeral is still the largest ever in Butte history.",

Historian Malcolm Ross later characterized the strike as \"the most expensive racial dispute of World War II\".",

The Maddox initiated the incident by opening fire, shooting off three \"warning\" shots; the North Vietnamese boats replied with torpedoes and machine gun fire.\n\nThe exchange caused ten North Vietnamese casualties and damaged one U.S. helicopter; there were no American casualties.\n\nIn response, the U.S. Congress passed a \"Gulf of Tonkin Resolution\", which granted U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by \"communist aggression\". The resolution served as Johnson's legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.\n\nOn television, President Johnson made misleading statements about the incident and portrayed U.S. military escalation as an act of defense. Since then, the Pentagon Papers, the memoirs of Robert McNamara, and NSA publications from 2005 have proven that the U.S. government lied about the nature of the incident to justify a war against Vietnam.",

        "description": "On this day in 1903, 800 Bulgarian rebels associated with the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) seized the North Macedonian town of Kru\u0161evo, beginning the Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottomon Empire.\n\nThe name of the uprising refers to Ilinden, another name for Elijah's Day (a Catholic commemoration of biblical prophet Elijah), and to Preobrazhenie which means \"Transfiguration\".\n\nOrganized by IMRO, a revolutionary organization dedicated to achieving autonomy for the regions of Macedonia and Adrianople from the Ottoman Empire, the revolt lasted from the beginning of August until the end of October, covering a vast territory from the eastern Black Sea to the shores of Lake Ohrid.\n\nAlthough the rebellion was successfully planned in secret, taking the Ottomans by surprise, many of its potential leaders had already been arrested or killed by the Empire. The revolution was crushed by overwhelming military force, and Turkish forces slaughtered the civilian population. Anarchist historian Georgi Khadziev wrote that 201 villages and 12,400 houses were burned, 4,694 people killed, and approximately 30,000 refugees fled to Bulgaria.\n\nThe survivors waged a guerrilla campaign for a few years, but the greater effect of the rebellion was the creation of the M\u00fcrzsteg reforms, which provided for foreign policing of the Macedonia region, financial compensation for victims of the violence, and establishment of ethnic boundaries in the region. These reforms, however, did little to solve the crisis, and the Empire lost nearly all of its European territory in the Balkan Wars of 1912-13.\n\nToday, August 2nd is a national holiday in North Macedonia, known as \"Day of the Republic\". There are towns named after the rebellion's leaders in both Bulgaria and North Macedonia.\n\nWhen the uprising began, IMRO issued a statement on its revolutionary aims. Here is a short excerpt:\n\n\"We are taking up arms against tyranny and inhumanity; we are fighting for freedom and humanity; our cause is thus higher than any national or ethnic differences. Therefore we express our solidarity with all others who suffer in the Sultan's dark Empire.\n\nToday it is not only the whole Christian population which suffers, but ordinary Turkish villagers as well. Our only enemies are the Turkish authorities, those who use arms against us, betray us, or who carry out acts of retaliation against helpless old people, women and children rather than against us, the rebels. We will fight these enemies and avenge all wrongs!\"",

Buckley at Cambridge University on the motion of \"Has the American Dream been achieved at the expense of the American Negro?\", stating \"I am stating this very seriously, and this is not an overstatement - I picked the cotton, and I carried it to market, and I built the railroads, under someone else's whip, for nothing. For nothing.\"\n\nBaldwin was also an anti-capitalist who expressed hope that socialism would take root in the United States. In 1972, when asked \"Do you think socialism will ever come to the U.S.A.?\", Baldwin replied:\n\n\"I would think so. I don't see any other way for it to go. But then you have to be very careful what you mean by socialism. When I use the word I'm not thinking about Lenin for example...Bobby Seale talks about a Yankee Doodle-type socialism...So that a socialism achieved in America, if and when we do...will be a socialism very unlike the Chinese socialism or the Cuban socialism...\n\n...the price of any real socialism here is the eradication of what we call the race problem...Racism is crucial to the system to keep blacks and whites at a division so both were and are a source of cheap labor.\"\n\nAfter the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Baldwin moved to Europe permanently, passing away in France on December 1st, 1987.\n\n\"Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.\"\n\n- James Baldwin",

        "description": "Roger Casement was a human rights journalist and Irish revolutionary who was executed on this day in 1916 by the British state for treason after trying to acquire military aid for Irish Republicans before the Easter Rising. Casement's work in the first decade of the 20th century exposed imperialist atrocities in the Congo and Peru.\n\nCasement began his career working for Henry Morton Stanley and the African International Association, a front for King Leopold II of Belgium in his efforts to colonize the Congo.\n\nIn 1890, Casement met author Joseph Conrad, who had come to the Congo to pilot a merchant ship. According to author Liesl Schillinger, both were inspired by the idea that \"European colonisation would bring moral and social progress to the continent and free its inhabitants 'from slavery, paganism and other barbarities.' Each would soon learn the gravity of his error.\"\n\nIn 1904, Casement published the \"Casement Report\", which, via interviews with workers, overseers, and mercenaries, exposed the enslavement, mutilation, and torture of natives on the rubber plantations. The report caused an international scandal and led to the creation of various reform organizations in the West.\n\nA few years later, Casement traveled to the Putumayo District in South America, where rubber was being harvested in the Amazon Basin, and exposed the treatment of indigenous people in Peru. Finding conditions just as inhumane as what he witnessed in the Congo, Casement interviewed both the Putumayo and men who had abused them, publishing his findings in a first-person narrative that again caused an international scandal.\n\nIn November, 1914 Casement helped form the Irish Volunteers. He traveled to both the United States and Germany to both promote the Irish nationalist cause and acquire aid for it.\n\nIn 1916, Casement was captured by the British government and charged with high treason after he attempted to acquire military aid from Germany to aid the Irish nationalist cause. During trial proceedings, the government secretly circulated alleged excerpts from Casement's journals, the \"Black Diaries\", which detailed sexual acts with other men. The authenticity of these documents is still debated today.\n\nCasement was hanged at Pentonville Prison on August 3rd, 1916 at 51 years old.\n\n\"Self government is our right, a thing born to us at birth a thing no more to be doled out to us by another people then the right to life itself then the right to feel the sun or smell the flowers or to love our kind.\"\n\n- Roger Casement",

Six served time in prison after refusing to renounce communism.\n\nThe names of the twelve arrested were John Ross Campbell, Jack Murphy, Wal Hannington, Ernie Cant, Tom Wintringham, Harry Pollitt, Hubert Inkpin, Arthur McManus, William Rust, Robin Page Arnot, William Gallacher, and Tom Bell.\n\nMany of those arrested were Party leaders. The CPGB elected to be silent on the arrests, for fear of the next set of leaders being arrested like the first.\n\nThe arrested communists were subjected to a highly politicized trial that lasted for eight days. Five of the group were sentenced to a year in prison for \"members of an illegal party carrying on illegal work in this country\".\n\nTo the remaining seven, the conservative judge offered an ultimatum: \"Those of you who will promise me that you will have nothing more to do with this association or the doctrine it preaches, I will bind over to be of good behaviour in the future. Those of you who do not promise will go to prison.\" All but one refused.",

Five years later, when surrounded by Spanish troops, he shot himself under the chin with a .45 caliber pistol to not give them the satisfaction of capturing him. Although the bullet went out of his forehead and knocked him unconscious, he survived. The wound left a great scar and gave him headaches for the rest of his life.\n\nGarc\u00eda played a key role in the ultimately successful War of 1895 and protested the subsequent lack of Cuban autonomy in the conclusion of the war (no Cuban was allowed to sign the terms of surrender and the Spanish leaders in Cuba were allowed to keep their posts in Santiago).\n\nAfter American military commander William Shafter excluded Cubans from negotiations for the surrender of Santiago, declined to invite Garc\u00eda to the surrender ceremonies, and let Spanish authorities remain in control of Santiago until the U.S. could establish a military government, Garc\u00eda resigned from the rebel army in protest on July 17th, 1898.\n\nGarc\u00eda died of pneumonia on December 11th, 1898 while on a diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. Today, his portrait is on the 50 Cuban peso banknote.",

UPS stated their losses during the strike were approximately $600 million, and the Teamsters took out a loan to pay $10 million to strikers manning picket lines.\n\nGrievances centered around UPS's use of part-time workers, which were paid less than full-time workers and constituted over 2/3rds of the workforce. Slogans of the campaign included \"Half a Job is Not Enough\" and \"Part-time American Won't Work!\".\n\nThe strike ended in victory for the union, resulting in a new contract that increased their wages, secured their existing benefits, and gave increased job security.",

Rioters looted stores, chanted political slogans, and damaged hotels. One group unsuccessfully attempted to hijack a boat.\n\nIn the middle of the afternoon, Fidel Castro arrived at the scene, by which time 370 arrests had taken place and around 30 people were injured, 11 of them policemen.\n\nA week later, on August 11th, Castro gave the order for border guards to not suppress illegal exits of the country; an estimated 33,000 people fled, leading to the 1994 Cuban Rafter Crisis.\n\nMany of these exiles successfully sought refuge in the United States, with then President Bill Clinton adopting the \"Wet feet, dry feet policy\", effectively allowing any Cuban who made it to U.S. land to stay, while Cubans intercepted in U.S. waters would be either returned to Cuba or deported elsewhere.",

Police indiscriminately attacked and harassed all present, including the activists, reporters, and bystanders. One reporter, a black woman, was called a racial slur and attacked, the aftermath of which was caught on film.\n\nIn total, 38 were injured, including several police officers, and 9 were arrested. More than 100 formal complaints about police brutality were filed. When questioned about it, Captain McNamara, a commander at the scene, said \"Obviously tempers flared. But all these allegations will be investigated.\" No cops were charged with any crime related to the event.\n\nThe Tompkins Square Park Riot figured prominently in the local arts community. Poet Allen Ginsburg was an eyewitness to the police riot, and various artists have alluded to it in their work, including Lou Reed, the industrial anarchist band Missing Foundation, and Jonathan Larson, in his musical \"Rent\".\n\nOn November 7th, 2004, about 1,000 people gathered in Tompkins Square Park to attend a concert held there in a yearly ritual commemorating the 1988 riot. According to the NYPD, when officers attempted an arrest for an open container of alcohol, concertgoers \"surrounded and assaulted\" the officers. Six arrests were made on charges including assault and inciting to riot.",

        "description": "On this day in 1945, the U.S. military dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, instantly killing at least 80,000 people - mostly civilians - and tens of thousands more over the following weeks. The U.S. censored images of the bombing until 1952.\n\nEye-witness accounts of the bombing's aftermath depicted a kind of apocalyptic horror: Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a German Jesuit priest, encountered a group of soldiers whose \"faces were wholly burned, their eye-sockets were hollow, the fluid from their melted eyes had run down their cheeks... Their mouths were mere swollen, pus-covered wounds, which they could not bear to stretch enough to admit the spout of the teapot.\"\n\nDr. Michihiko Hachiya, a survivor, spoke of \"streetcars were standing and inside were dozens of bodies, blackened beyond recognition. I saw fire reservoirs filled to the brim with dead bodies who looked as they had been boiled alive\".\n\nPresident Harry Truman made the case to the public that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a necessary and humanitarian means of forcing Japan's surrender. This view was not held, however, by military commanders or leftist American dissidents.\n\nOnce American forces had Japan under military control, they imposed censorship on many images related to the U.S. bombing campaign. Among the images banned was a picture of a partially incinerated Nagasaki child, taken by Japanese photographer Y\u014dsuke Yamahata. These restrictions were not lifted until 1952.\n\nAmong the first Americans to denounce the bombing were socialists such as the Trotskyist James P. Cannon, who publicly denounced the use of nuclear weapons as \"an unspeakable atrocity\".\n\nThe dissent of military commanders was not public, however. In 1950, Admiral William Leahy, Truman's chief of staff, wrote: \"The use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan\". In his memoirs, President Eisenhower, then General of the Army, confessed that \"dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary\".",

She joined the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) in 1936 and late in life, in 1961, became its chairwoman.\n\nFlynn was also a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), but was expelled in 1940 during an institution-wide purge of all communists from ACLU leadership. This decision was reversed twelve years after her death, in 1976.\n\nIn 1948, Flynn was arrested, along with eleven other prominent members of the Communist Party, for violating the Smith Act. She served two years in prison, and continued her political activism after her release.\n\nFlynn died during a visit to the Soviet Union, where she was accorded a state funeral with processions in the Red Square attended by over 25,000 people.\n\n\"I fell in love with my country - its rivers, prairies, forests, mountains, cities and people. No one can take my love of country away from me! I felt then, as I do now, it's a rich, fertile, beautiful land, capable of satisfying all the needs of its people.

In 1864, Union Army soldiers camped on the Anderson plantation and freed him. Subsequently, he moved to Dayton, Ohio with his family, finding work as a sexton with the Wesleyan Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1865, he received a letter from Colonel P.H. Anderson, his former master, who requested that Jourdon return to the plantation in a last-ditch to save the farm, which had fallen into disrepair after the Civil War.\n\nOn August 7th, 1865, Jourdon dictated his response. Here are some excerpts (the letter in full is linked below):\n\n\"I got your letter, and was glad to find that you had not forgotten Jourdon, and that you wanted me to come back and live with you again, promising to do better for me than anybody else can. I have often felt uneasy about you. I thought the Yankees would have hung you long before this, for harboring Rebs they found at your house.\n\n...[My wife and I] have concluded to test your sincerity by asking you to send us our wages for the time we served you...I served you faithfully for thirty-two years, and Mandy twenty years. At twenty-five dollars a month for me, and two dollars a week for Mandy, our earnings would amount to eleven thousand six hundred and eighty dollars.\n\nAdd to this the interest for the time our wages have been kept back, and deduct what you paid for our clothing, and three doctor's visits to me, and pulling a tooth for Mandy, and the balance will show what we are in justice entitled to. Please send the money by Adams's Express, in care of V. Winters, Esq., Dayton, Ohio. If you fail to pay us for faithful labors in the past, we can have little faith in your promises in the future.\n\n...P.S.\u2014Say howdy to George Carter, and thank him for taking the pistol from you when you were shooting at me.\"\n\nJourdon's offer was declined, and he continued to live in Dayton, dying there at the age of 81 in 1907. Colonel Anderson, having failed to attract his former slaves back, sold the land for a pittance to try to get out of debt, dying two years later.\n\nPrior to 2006, historian Raymond Winbush tracked down the living relatives of the Colonel Anderson, reporting that they \"are still angry at Jordan for not coming back\", knowing that the plantation was in serious disrepair after the war.",

Over the following days, the mass demonstrations devolved into violent riots as the military fired into crowds of protesters.\n\nThe 8888 Uprising, also known as the People Power Uprising, took place in the context of an economic crisis in the country, governed as a one-party state by the Burma Socialist Programme Party, led by General Ne Win. Students and farmers had been engaging in protest and campaigns of rebellion against various state economic policies since 1985.\n\nOn August 8th, 1988 (thus the uprising's name) mass anti-government demonstrations took place throughout the country. Participants came from a wide variety of demographics - Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, students, workers, young and old participated.\n\nThe protests began relatively peacefully, with only one casualty reported on the first day, the result of a frightened traffic cop who fired into the crowd and fled. Over the next few days, the protests devolved into violent riots as the military and police fired on the protesters, at one point even shooting doctors and nurses tending to the wounded.\n\nProtesters responded by throwing Molotov cocktails, swords, knives, rocks, poisoned darts and bicycle spokes. In one incident, rioters burned a police station and killed four fleeing police officers.\n\nOn August 26th, Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of anti-imperialist revolutionary Aung San, addressed half a million people at Shwedagon Pagoda, becoming an international figure in the uprising, supported by the West. Her party would later go on to win elections in 1990, however these results were ignored by the military government and she was arrested.\n\nOn September 18th, the military retook power in the country, with General Saw Maung repealing the 1974 constitution and imposing martial law. The demonstrations were violently suppressed and, by the end of September, at least 3,000 people were killed, however estimates of casualties vary widely.\n\nMany of the student leaders of the uprising became lifelong activists, also playing a role in the 2007 Saffron Revolution nineteen years later.",

When revolution broke out in 1910, he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Zapata was responsible for defeating and ousting various invading armies from Morelos on multiple occasions.\n\nOn April 10th, 1919, Zapata was assassinated, double-crossed by a member of the Mexican Army who had pretended to switch sides. When Zapata attempted to meet with the would-be defector, he was ambushed and shot to death.\n\n\"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.\"\n\n- Emiliano Zapata",

The group was founded in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois on September 23rd, 1968, one hundred years after the Grito de Lares uprising. Jim\u00e9nez was born to j\u00edbaro parents in Caguas, Puerto Rico, but spent his formative years in Chicago.\n\nIn the summer of 1968, he was picked up for a possession of heroin charge and given a 60-day sentence at Cook County Jail. While in jail, he read \"The Seven Story Mountain\" by Thomas Merton, and became politically radicalized, also reading texts from radicals such as MLK Jr. and Malcolm X.\n\nAfter his release, Jim\u00e9nez transformed the Young Lords from a street gang into a human rights organization, entering into the \"Rainbow Coalition\" with Fred Hampton, head of the BPP's Chicago chapter. After Hampton's assassination by the Chicago Police and FBI, and the Coalition's dissolution, Jim\u00e9nez continued his activism, running for a Chicago Alderman position in 1975, and helping organize a voter registration drive to support Harold Washington's 1982-83 mayoral campaign.\n\nWhen asked in a 2018 interview what happened to the Young Lords, Jim\u00e9nez responded:\n\n\"The question is what happened to the white left, who decided to abandon the Black Panthers and Young Lords when things got hot, as if these groups who risked everything were just, some kind of a fad or that their movement was just some kind of entertainment...\n\n...We will always be reminded of how COINTELPRO and others have worked to split our movement so that we cannot organize together to free our nation of Puerto Rico. We will always work for unity. 'Unidos venceremos' or 'United will win!' It is not just a saying for us. It is a goal.\"\n\n\"If the People of El Salvador can ask for self-determination, if the People of Nicaragua can ask for self-determination, if the People of Ireland can ask for self-determination, if the People of Poland can ask for self-determination, if Black People in America can stand up and demand self-determination, then Puerto Ricans demand self-determination.\" \n\n- Jos\u00e9 Cha Cha Jim\u00e9nez",

Six civilians were killed that day, including Father Hugh Mullan, who notified the Army that he was entering the area to help a wounded man, and was shot to death while brandishing a white flag.\n\nAnother person killed was Joseph Murphy, who was shot as he stood opposite the Army Base. He was taken into custody, where he was beaten and shot again before being released and expiring.\n\nThe violence continued for two more days, killing eleven people in total. A 2021 coroner's report found that all those killed had been innocent and that the killings were \"without justification\".\n\nThe same battalion that committed this massacre later shot twenty-six unarmed civilians during a protest march in Derry against the internment without trial policy.\n\nThe Ballymurphy Massacre is the subject of the August 2018 documentary \"The Ballymurphy Precedent\", directed by Callum Macrae and made in association with Channel 4.",

In 1928, he joined the African National Congress (ANC), but soon left, finding it ineffectual.\n\nThe following year, he joined the SACP, quickly working his way up the party ladder and becoming a member of its Politburo. In 1939, he was elected General Secretary.\n\nRemaining close to the ANC, he was elected to its National Executive Committee in 1946. Under Kotane's leadership, the SACP, together with the ANC, organized various anti-apartheid demonstrations and labor strikes, and his high profile in both organizations made him a major target of the South African government's political repression.\n\nIn 1963, he left South Africa to lead the SACP in-exile from Tanzania.\n\nHe died in 1978 after suffering a stroke at the age of 72. Moses was survived by his wife Rebecca Kotane, who went on to became the last living elder of the anti-apartheid struggle, as old as the African National Congress (ANC) itself, dying in 2021 at the age of 108.\n\n\"My first suggestion is that the party becomes Africanised, that the CPSA must pay special attention to South Africa and study the conditions in this country and concretise the demands of the masses from first-hand information, that we must speak the language of the native masses and must know their demands, that while it must not lose its international allegiance, the Party must be Bolshevised and become South African not only theoretically but in reality.\"\n\n- Moses Maunane Kotane, 1934",

        "description": "On this day in 1680, indigenous Pueblo peoples of present-day New Mexico rose in rebellion against Spanish colonizers in what is now called the \"Pueblo Revolt\", driving Spanish settlers out of the area for twelve years.\n\nAccording to the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 was the only successful Native uprising against a colonizing power in North America.\n\nSpain first claimed the region in the 16th century, subjecting Puebloans to episodes of colonial violence and displacement. The Spanish demanded payment of heavy tribute from indigenous communities and destroyed ceremonial buildings in an attempt to eradicate indigenous beliefs and impose Christianity.\n\nDuring the 1670s, conflict intensified as famine put the communities there in direct competition for scarce resources. In one incident, 47 Pueblo medicine men were arrested by Spanish forces in 1675 under charges of \"sorcery\".\n\nBy 1680, one of the arrested men, Po\u2019Pay, had met with several Pueblo leaders and formed a military alliance. Although Po\u2019Pay is often cited as the leader of the rebellion, it is likely there were several other instrumental organizers who played an important role in its fruition.\n\nThe date of a cross-Pueblo revolt was set for August 11th, with time being kept at each Pueblo by untying a knot from a cord everyday until all the knots had been untied. Spanish forces, however, learned of the revolt on August 9th after capturing two messengers from Tesuque. As a result, Po\u2019Pay ordered military action a day early, on August 10th.\n\nPueblo rebels quickly succeeding in sealing off roads, destroying colonial settlements, and laying siege to the regional capital of Santa Fe.\n\nIn total, Puebloans killed 400 Spaniards and drove the remaining 2,000 settlers out of the area. On August 21st, New Mexico governor Antonio de Oterm\u00edn fled, leading a southward retreat out of the region.\n\nWith the Spanish gone, Po\u2019Pay traveled the region, promoting the revival of indigenous beliefs and destroying churches and other symbols of Catholicism in the region. Pueblos largely returned to communal self-governance after the flight of the Spanish.\n\nSpanish colonizers attempted to retake the Pueblos in 1681, 1688, and 1689, finally succeeding in 1692.",

        "description": "On this day in 1970, more than 900 inmates at Tombs Prison in Manhattan, New York City took over the prison after multiple warnings about falling budgets, aging facilities, and rising prison populations were ignored by the city.\n\nThe situation was so dire that union correctional officers had initiated an informational picket of City Hall to protest the living conditions. Overcrowding was so severe that more than 2,000 people were being held in space meant for less than a 1,000.\n\nOn August 10th, 1970, prisoners seized control of the entire ninth floor of the facility, taking several officers hostage for eight hours, until state officials agreed to hear prisoner grievances and take no punitive action against the rioters.\n\nDespite that promise, Mayor John Lindsay had the leaders behind the action shipped upstate to the state's Attica Correctional Facility, possibly contributing to the Attica Prison riot about a year later.\n\nThe August uprising preceded another rebellion in Tombs Prison in October later that year. Inmates again seized staff as hostages and made demands to improve their living conditions, such as more education, lower bail, and an \"inmate council\" to mediate prisoner complaints.\n\nAfter the October uprising, NYC Commissioner of Correction George McGrath fired two black guards at the Tombs, both of whom had reported abuse of inmates by other guards and expressed sympathy for the prisoners' cause.\n\nFollowing the August uprising, the New York City Legal Aid Society filed a class action suit on behalf of pre-trial detainees held in the Tombs. The city decided to close the facility on December 20th, 1974 after years of litigation and a federal judge declaring that the prison's conditions were bad enough to be considered unconstitutional.",

        "description": "On this day in 1965, the Watts Riots began in Los Angeles after police beat Marquette Fry and his family after he was pulled over for drunk driving. The uprising was the largest in city history until the Rodney King riots of 1992, with 34 deaths and $40 million in property damage across a 46 square mile (119 square km) stretch of L.A.\n\nThe uprising took place in the context of a highly racialized city, with severely discriminatory housing, educational, and economic practices. The community of Watts was predominantly black and regularly suffered brutality at the hands of police.\n\nAfter Marquette, along with his brother and mother, were beaten and arrested by police, an angry mob formed and riots broke out. For the next six days, rioters clashed with police and armed National Guardsmen, who had been sent by the thousands to suppress the uprising.\n\nLos Angeles Chief of Police William Parker (incidentally, Parker also coined the phrase \"thin blue line\" around this time) compared the rioters to the Viet Cong, promising a \"paramilitary\" response to the disorder. One officer later stated \"The streets of Watts resembled an all-out war zone in some far-off foreign country, it bore no resemblance to the United States of America.\"\n\nBetween 31,000 and 35,000 people participated in the riots, while 70,000 people were \"sympathetic, but not active\" according to John H. Barnhill. Over the six days of rioting, there were 34 deaths (23 of which were the result of police shootings), 1,032 injuries, 3,438 arrests, and over $40 million in property damage.\n\nFollowing the uprising's suppression, a wave of white flight occurred in surrounding areas, leading to significant demographic changes in areas such as Compton and Huntington Park.\n\nA government committee known as the McCone Commission concluded that the cause of the riots was primarily socio-economic, and recommended reforms along these lines. Most of these recommendations were not adopted.\n\n\"The whole point of the outbreak in Watts was that it marked the first major rebellion of Negroes against their own masochism and was carried on with the express purpose of asserting that they would no longer quietly submit to the deprivation of slum life.\"\n\n- Bayard Rustin",

        "description": "Fidel Castro, born on this day in 1926, was a Cuban revolutionary and politician who served as Prime Minister of Cuba from 1959 to 1976 and its President from 1976 to 2008.\n\nCastro came into power in early 1959 after years of revolutionary struggle against the U.S.-backed regime of Fulgencio Batista (1901 - 1973). Ideologically a Marxist-Leninist and Cuban nationalist, he also served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011.\n\nWith Castro as Prime Minister, the Cuban government nationalized and expanded healthcare and education, redistributed land to the peasant class, and implemented rent controls.\n\nUnder Castro's leadership, Cuba also exported aid abroad, sending troops and doctors to assist Agostinho Neto and the left-wing MPLA during the Angolan Civil War, and establishing a significant program of medical internationalism in the Global South. In 2007, Robert Huish and John M. Kirk wrote that Cuba was providing more medical personnel to the developing world than all G8 countries combined.\n\n\"The fact is, when men carry the same ideals in their hearts, nothing can isolate them - neither prison walls nor the sod of cemeteries. For a single memory, a single spirit, a single idea, a single conscience, a single dignity will sustain them all.\"\n\n- Fidel Castro",

Workers established strong trade unions and won better working conditions.\n\nBefore the strike began, workers were paid extremely poorly and did not have regular hours. Instead, they would show up en masse to work and a handful would be selected - the rest would be sent home without payment. In this way, their employers could only pay for exactly the labor needed for the day.\n\nOn August 14th, led by socialist union organizer Ben Tillet, the men in the West India Dock struck immediately and started persuading other dockers to join them. The support they needed came when the Amalgamated Stevedores Union (whose workers were essential the operation of the dock), under Tom McCarthy, joined the strike.\n\nThe labor action became so large (one estimation was 130,000 workers), that it could possibly be considered a general strike. A newspaper reported \"Dockmen, lightermen, bargemen, cement workers, carmen, ironworkers and even factory girls are coming out.\"\n\nThe London Dock Strike resulted in a victory for the 100,000 strikers and established strong trade unions amongst London dockers, one of which became the nationally important \"Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union\".\n\nThe success of the Dockers' Strike was a turning point in the history of trade unionism, with unskilled workers in particular gaining confidence to organize and engage in collective action. From 750,000 workers in 1888, trade union membership grew to more than 2 million by 1899.",

Initially demanding the same war bonus that had been given to men, their demands morphed into equal pay, more than forty years before the Equal Pay Act. The slogan of the strike was \"Same Work - Same Pay\".\n\nThe strike spread throughout the city - an estimated 18,000 out of a total 27,000 women working in the public transport industry participated.\n\nThe strike was settled on the 25th of August. The women won the 5 shilling war bonus, but not equal pay. According to historian Dr. Cathy Hunt, this labor action was \"an important step along the way to full gender equality\".",

The Marikana Massacre took place on the 25-year anniversary of a nationwide strike by over 300,000 South African workers.\n\nOn August 10th, miners had initiated a wildcat strike at a site owned by Lonmin in the Marikana area, close to Rustenburg, South Africa. Although ten people (mostly workers) had been killed before August 16th, it was on that day that an elite force from the South African Police Service fired into a crowd of strikers with rifles, killing 34 and injuring 76.\n\nAfter surveying the aftermath of the violence, photojournalist Greg Marinovich concluded that \"[it is clear] that heavily armed police hunted down and killed the miners in cold blood.\"\n\nFollowing the massacre, a massive wave of strikes occurred across the South African mining sector - in early October, analysts estimated that approximately 75,000 miners were on strike from various gold and platinum mines and companies across South Africa, most of them doing so illegally.\n\nA year after the Marikana Massacre, author Benjamin Fogel wrote \"Perhaps the most important lesson of Marikana is that the state can gun down dozens of black workers with little or no backlash from 'civil society', the judicial system or from within the institutions that supposedly form the bedrock of democracy.\"",

At the time, only approximately 11% of adult males could vote, very few of them in the industrial north, which was the worst hit by the crises.\n\nReformers, led by figures such as the radical orator Henry Hunt and social reformer Samuel Bamford, identified democratic and parliamentary reforms as a way to mobilize the masses, acquiring three-quarters of a million signatures in 1817, a proposal flatly rejected by the House of Commons.\n\nOn August 16th, 1819, a mass rally of democratic reformers gathered in St. Peter's Field in Manchester. The meeting's aims were explicitly peaceful and legal; organizers stated the protest's purpose was \"to consider the propriety of adopting the most LEGAL and EFFECTUAL means of obtaining a reform in the Common House of Parliament\" and did not allow participants to bear arms.\n\nDespite this, members of the British Cavalry attempted to arrest leaders of the protest. When their horses became stuck in the crowd, officers panicked and began indiscriminately attacking the meeting's participants. Exact numbers are difficult to calculate, but modern estimates are that 18 people were killed and approximately 600 more were injured.\n\nAmong those killed was a two year old boy, knocked from his mother's arms by a charging horse. John Lees, a working class veteran of Waterloo who later died of wounds sustained at the Peterloo Massacre, stated \"At Waterloo there was man to man but there it was downright murder\".\n\nThe British government supported the military's actions and, as a result of the disorder, passed the \"Six Acts\", legislation to suppress radical meetings and publications. By the end of 1820, every significant working-class radical reformer was in jail.\n\nOn the political situation after Peterloo, historian Robert Reid wrote \"it is not fanciful to compare the restricted freedoms of the British worker in the post-Peterloo period in the early nineteenth century with those of the black South African in the post-Sharpeville period of the late twentieth century.\"",

        "description": "Marcus Garvey, born on this day in 1887, was a Jamaican political activist, author, and orator who became one of the most influential black nationalist and Pan-Africanist leaders of the 20th century.\n\nGarvey was born to a moderately prosperous Afro-Jamaican family in Saint Ann's Bay, Jamaica, and apprenticed into the print trade as a teenager. Working in Kingston, he became involved in trade unionism before living briefly in Costa Rica, Panama, and England.\n\nGreatly influenced by Booker T. Washington's autobiography \"Up From Slavery\", Garvey began to support economic separatism and social segregation. In 1914, he founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL, commonly known as UNIA), through which he declared himself Provisional President of Africa. Ideologically a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist, his ideas came to be known as \"Garveyism\".\n\nGarvey launched various businesses in the U.S., including the Negro Factories Corporation and Negro World newspaper. In 1919, he became President of the Black Star Line shipping and passenger company, designed to forge a link between North America and Africa and facilitate African-American migration to Liberia.\n\nIn 1923, Garvey was convicted of mail fraud for selling the company's stock and imprisoned in the U.S. Penitentiary Atlanta for nearly two years. Garvey blamed Jewish people for his sentence, claiming that they were prejudiced against him because of his links to the Ku Klux Klan, whom he had collaborated with on the basis of their shared goal of racial separatism.\n\nGarvey's influence has been repeatedly emphasized by black intellectuals - Kwame Nkrumah cited \"The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey\" as the text that most inspired him, American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates described Garvey as the \"patron saint\" of the black nationalist movement, and scholar Molefi Kete Asante included Garvey on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.\n\nThose who dissented from this view include W.E.B. Du Bois, who, after hearing of Garvey's meeting with the KKK, called him the greatest enemy of the Negro race, and radical labor organizer A. Philip Randolph, who stated that Garvey and Garveyism should be purged from American soil.\n\nGarvey spent his last years in Jamaica trying to revive his political fortunes. He died in London, England in 1940.\n\n\"A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots.\"\n\n- Marcus Garvey",

First could not attend meetings, publish, and or be quoted. In 1963, she was imprisoned and held in isolation without charge for 117 days under the Ninety-Day Detention Law, the first white woman to be detained under this law.\n\nIn August of 1982, First was assassinated by South African police in Mozambique, where she was working in exile. Her funeral in Maputo was attended by presidents, members of parliament and envoys from 34 countries.\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), established in 1996 following the fall of apartheid, granted amnesty to Craig Williamson and Roger Raven, two of the men responsible for killing First.",

        "description": "On this day in 1823, more than 10,000 enslaved Guyanese people rose up against their oppressors. Rebels held whites hostage to make demands, but generally abhorred violence. The state declared martial law, killing hundreds of people and displaying their corpses as a warning to the survivors.\n\nThe revolt took place in modern day Guyana, then the British colony of Demerara-Essequibo. The colony's primary export was sugar, and enslaved black people drastically outnumbered other groups on the island. The year of the uprising, the population consisted of approximately 2,500 whites, 2,500 freed black people, and 77,000 slaves.\n\nThe rebellion was linked to the church of John Smith, a British missionary. One of the leaders of the uprising was Jack Gladstone, a cooper on the plantation where the rebellion started and the son of Quamina, a prominent member of Smith's church.\n\nUpon learning of his son's plans, Quamina opposed the revolt, urging the planners to initiate a strike instead, and to not use violence. Quamina also informed John Smith of the plans, which Smith declined to disclose to the authorities.\n\nOn August 18th, 1823, more than 10,000 enslaved people rose up against their masters to demand better treatment. Rebels generally abhorred violence, choosing instead to hold whites hostage in their homes and stockades as leverage with which to make their demands. Despite the large scale of the revolt, some of the enslaved stayed loyal to their masters and defended their plantations.\n\nThe Governor immediately declared martial law, and, when a crowd of 2,000 rebels refused to disperse on order of a colonial militia, soldiers fired into the crowd, killing hundreds of people. Within two days, the rebellion was suppressed.\n\nIn the weeks following the suppression of uprising, the colonizers executed dozens of slaves, displaying the dismembered heads of those killed as a means of intimidation.\n\nJack Gladstone was sold and deported to St. Lucia, while Quamina was hunted down and killed on September 23rd. John Smith was arrested for not informing the government of the plans of rebellion and died in prison. Smith's death made him a martyr within the British abolitionist movement.\n\nUnder pressure from London, the Demerara Court of Policy passed various reforms for slave labor in 1825, institutionalizing working hours and some civil rights for the enslaved.\n\nIn 1833, the British government passed the Slavery Abolition Act, beginning a process of gradual abolition throughout its colonies.

When the AIOC refused to cooperate with the Iranian government, the parliament voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country.\n\nIn response, the British began a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically and engaged in subterfuge to undermine Mosaddegh's government.\n\nJudging Mosaddegh to be unreliable and fearing a communist takeover, Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration overthrew Iran's government. The coup action was also supported by the Iranian clergy, who opposed Mosaddegh's secularism.\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) hired mobsters to stage pro-Shah riots and paid people to travel to Tehran and take over the streets of the city. Between 200 and 300 people were killed in the ensuing mayhem.\n\nMosaddegh was arrested, tried, and convicted of treason by the Shah's military court. Many of his supporters were imprisoned, several received the death penalty.

The mostly women immigrant strikers enjoyed broad support from rank-and-file labor, but the strike failed after labor leadership declined to support them.\n\nThe Grunwick Dispute was one of the first black and migrant worker struggles that won broad support from the labor movement. According to Socialist Appeal, this was in sharp contrast to a 1974 dispute in Leicester, where lay union officials were hostile to the Asian workers. These officials actively colluded to create pay inequity for white and non-white workers. \n\nThe Grunwick firm relied almost exclusively on the labor of immigrant women, who were paid poorly and forced to work long hours. Of the company's 440 employees, 80% were of Asian origin and 10% of Afro-Caribbean origin, and application forms for employment at Grunwick asked for passport numbers and \"date of arrival in the UK.\"\n\nThe racist basis for these working conditions was explained by the strikers: \"Imagine how humiliating it was for us, particularly for older women, to be working and to overhear the employer saying to a younger, English girl 'you don't want to come and work here, love, we won't be able to pay the sort of wages that'll keep you here' \u2013 while we had to work there because we were trapped.\"\n\nThe strike was sparked by the dismissal of Devshi Bhudia on August 20th, 1976. Three other workers, Chandrakant Patel, Bharat Patel and Suresh Ruparelia, walked out in solidarity.\n\nBy August 23rd, six workers began picketing outside Grunwick offices. Soon, postal workers began to refuse crossing the picket line to deliver mail, and the size of the pickets began to grow as workers from other industries joined the protest in solidarity. In this fashion, the Grunwick Dispute became the first labor struggle where majority non-white strikers received widespread support from the labor movement (similar, previous disputes did not enjoy solidarity from white workers and racist unions).\n\nMeanwhile, Grunwick raised pay by 15% for non-striking workers on the condition that they would not join the union. In June and July of 1977, workers from across London began trying to prevent scabs from showing up to work, leading to violent conflicts with police and widespread media coverage.\n\nThe dispute was reported nightly on the national television, often showing violent clashes between strikers and the paramilitary Metropolitan Police's Special Patrol Group. More than 500 people were arrested, the most since the general strike of 1926.\n\nThe incumbent Labour government commissioned the \"Scarman Inquiry\", which recommended both union recognition and re-instatement of the workers, but the employer, backed by the right-wing National Association For Freedom (NAFF) and the Conservative Party, successfully rejected these recommendations.\n\nThe Trades Union Congress (TUC) subsequently withdrew their support, and the workers' strike committee announced the end of the dispute in June 1978. The strike's defeat was a major victory for the British right-wing, which began to successfully undermine the power of labor under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, who became Prime Minister in 1979.\n\nOn the strike, one of its leaders, Jayaben Desai, stated: \"The strike is not so much about pay, it is a strike about human dignity.\"",

After thirty minutes of being pursued by police, she died after being shot 86-87 times and subsequently became an international symbol for animal rights.\n\nTyke had been captured as a baby in Mozambique in 1973 and was shipped to the United States to be used as a circus animal. She had been involved in had escaped twice prior to her killing on August 20th.\n\nOn August 20th, 1994, during a performance at Circus International in Honolulu, Hawaii, Tyke trampled and critically injured her groomer, Dallas Beckwith, throwing him around numerous times in the process. She also killed her trainer, Allen Campbell, when he attempted to save Beckwith, knocking him to the ground and crushing him to death under her trunk.\n\nTyke then escaped and police pursued her for a half an hour, riddling her with bullets. After being shot 86-87 times, Tyke finally collapsed from nerve damage and brain hemorrhages.\n\nFollowing the incident, Tyke became a symbol for animal rights. Lawsuits were filed against the City of Honolulu, the State of Hawaii, the circus, and Tyke's owner, John Cuneo Jr. These suits were settled out of court.\n\nAlthough no official ban on animal acts materialized at the arena where the incident occurred, no circus featuring exotic animals has performed at the Blaisdell Arena since Tyke's killing.",

Romania and Albania declined to participate in the attack, the latter of which left the Warsaw Pact a month later.\n\nThe invasion took place in the context of liberal reforms promoted by the communist government of Alexander Dub\u010dek, known as the \"Prague Spring\". The reforms included a decentralization of administrative authority, loosening of restrictions on the media, speech and travel, and the decision to split into two countries, the Czech and Slovak Republics.\n\nThe reforms were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent ~200,000 Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. 137 civilians were killed and 500 seriously wounded during the occupation.\n\nDub\u010dek and the Chairman of the National Assembly Josef Smrkovsky were arrested and taken to Moscow. They were allowed to return after adopting the \"Moscow Protocol\", which effectively reversed the liberalization of the Prague Spring.\n\nThe occupation was met with widespread, mostly non-violent resistance. Civilians purposely gave wrong directions to invading soldiers and painted over direction-giving signs. On January 19th, 1969, student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague to protest the renewed suppression of free speech. On September 8th, 1968, Polish accountant Ryszard Siwiec immolated himself in Warsaw during a harvest festival in protest of the invasion.\n\nThe invasion caused major fractures in communist movements worldwide, both inside and outside the Soviet bloc. Several KGB/GRU defectors and spies such as Oleg Gordievsky, Vasili Mitrokhin, and Dmitri Polyakov cited the 1968 invasion as their motivation for cooperating with the Western Intelligence agencies.\n\nInternationally, the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) suffered a major split over the internal disputes over the Prague Spring, while Albania left the Warsaw Pact following the invasion. The People's Republic of China strongly condemned the military action; on August 23rd, 1968, at the Beijing Romanian Embassy, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai denounced the Soviet Union for \"fascist politics, great power chauvinism, national egoism, and social imperialism\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Portuguese Communist Party, the South African Communist Party, and the Communist Party USA all supported the Soviet position.",

        "description": "On this day in 1948, workers of the British-owned African Wharfage Company (AWC) began a work stoppage that turned into a general strike, paralyzing the city for weeks and leading the government to declare a state of emergency.\n\nPart of the power of this strike came from the fact that the AWC held a monopoly on cargo shipping in the port of Zanzibar City - when their workers struck, supplies across the region were affected. One example of this is when, on August 26th, an Italian cruise liner arrived in Zanzibar seeking water supplies, but could not get it due to the dockworkers' strike.\n\nThe labor action did not begin as a general strike. Abbas Othman, an AWC worker and strike leader, had attempted to involve other labor groups, but they initially declined.\n\nAs food shortages began to occur, Zanzibar President Glenday ordered that all weapons were to be delivered to the police station and banned all meetings not approved by the Chief of Police. A few days later, he declared sweeping emergency powers that gave the government control over food and movement of people.\n\nDespite this repression, the general strike succeeded, both in the short term and the long. By December 1st, 1948, the AWC had increased all of their laborers' wage rates. Higher wages and better conditions were also put in place for workers involved in the packing of produce for export, the bakery trade, the soap and oil factories, government, and coconut husking. A Port Labour Advisory Committee was also formed to advise the government of labor conditions for port workers.",

Worried about the spread of communism during the Cold War, President Reagan's administration gave billions of dollars to the right-wing Salvadoran government.\n\nIn August 1982, the Salvadoran military launched an operation in San Vicente, a rural area that was a guerrilla stronghold at the time. The army sent about 6,000 troops to rid the area of rebel presence, including the elite Atlacatl Battalion, trained at the infamous \"School of the Americas\" and previously responsible for the El Mozote Massacre, in which several hundred captured civilians were killed.\n\nOn the night of August 21st, a group of internally displaced people was overtaken beside the Amatit\u00e1n river state troops. At a spot called \"El Calabozo\" (\"The Dungeon\"), the battalion surrounded the IDPs and opened fire at close range. Survivors allege that the soldiers then threw many of the bodies into the river and threw acid on some corpses, making an accurate count of the violence difficult.\n\nJoaquin Portillo, a survivor whose family was killed, played dead after being shot.

He learned how to read and write at a young age and was deeply religious, eventually becoming an influential preacher in the area.\n\nIn early 1831, on the basis of religious visions, Nat Turner began preparing an insurrection. It began on August 21st, 1831, and rebels traveled from house to house, freeing slaves and killing many of the white people that they encountered.\n\nAt least 55 whites were killed, among them men, women, and children. The group spared a few homes \"because Turner believed the poor white inhabitants 'thought no better of themselves than they did of negroes'\", according to historian Stephen Oates.\n\nThe rebellion was put down by a combined force of local militia and three companies of artillery. The state executed 56 black people, and militias killed at least 100 more, some of whom were not involved in the rebellion.\n\nTurner went on the run, eluding capture for six weeks. On October 30th, 1831, a white farmer discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails.\n\nAfter being tried and convicted for \"conspiring to rebel and making insurrection\", Turner was asked if he regretted what he had done. He responded \"Was Christ not crucified?\"\n\nTurner was hanged by the government on November 11th, 1831. His body was dissected and flayed, with his bones and skin being used to create trophies and souvenirs, such as purses.\n\nAfter Turner's execution, state legislatures passed new laws prohibiting education of both enslaved and free black people, restricting rights of assembly and other civil liberties for free black people, and requiring white ministers to be present at all worship services.",

Expelled from Moscow State University, Bogdanov eventually graduated from the University of Kharkiv as a qualified medical doctor.\n\nAround the same time, Bogdanov became a political prisoner and was arrested by the Tsar's police, spent six months in prison, and then exiled to Vologda. In 1903, Bogdanov played a key role in the formation and organization of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Party.\n\nIn the following years, Bogdanov became a political rival of Vladimir Lenin. In 1909, Lenin published a scathing book of criticism of Bognadov's ideas (Materialism and Empiriocriticism), accusing him of philosophical idealism. Later that year, Bognadov was defeated in a Paris party conference and expelled from the Bolsheviks.\n\nAfter the October Revolution, Bogdanov refused invitations to rejoin the party. In 1923, he was arrested by the GPU (Soviet secret police) for suspicion of involvement in the socialist opposition group \"Workers' Truth\", although he was released without charge.\n\nBognadov contributed to a wide variety of fields, including philosophy, creative writing, political economy, and a precursor to systems theory he called \"tektology\".\n\nIn 1928, Bogdanov died suddenly after taking an experimental blood transfusion from a student suffering from malaria and tuberculosis.",

By 1792, rebels controlled a third of the island.\n\nThe Haitian Revolution was a successful insurrection by people enslaved by French colonizers in Saint-Domingue, now the sovereign state of Haiti. Some sources also list the rebellion as beginning August 21st.\n\nHaiti would go on to achieve independence from France in 1804, 13 years later. The Haitian Revolution was the only slave uprising that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery and ruled by its former captives, according to historian Franklin W. Knight.\n\nToussaint Louverture went on to become a military leader of the revolution, but died shortly before independence was won. His former lieutenant, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, became the first leader of the newly independent nation in 1804.\n\nBetween 100,000 - 200,000 black people (out of 500,000 total) died in the time between the initial uprising and independence thirteen years later. 24,000 of the 40,000 white people on the island were killed.\n\nIn 1825, French King Charles X surrounded Haiti with warships and coerced the government into agreeing to pay a debt of 150 million gold francs in reparations to French slavers, a debt that immiserated the new country's economy.\n\n\"We have dared to be free. Let us dare to be so by ourselves and for ourselves.\"\n\n- Jean-Jacques Dessalines",

The strike was triggered on July 10th, a payday on which many workers were shorted by the Pressed Steel Car Company.\n\nThe strike began on July 13th, and grew to include more than 8,000 workers, 3,000 of whom were also from the Standard Steel Car Company. By the next day, 500 cops began working to protect strikebreakers and evict strikers from company houses. The New York Times called the immigrant workforce \"savages\" and \"illiterate foreigners\".\n\nManagement refused to speak with the workers' representatives and James Rider, manager of the Pressed Steel Car Company, responded to their strike by hiring Pearl Bergoff, a notorious owner of a strike-breaking paramilitary force.\n\nThe workers were joined by members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), including founders William Trautmann and \"Big Bill\" Haywood, as well as \"Smiling Joe\" Ettor.\n\nThe walkout drew national attention when, on this day in 1909, a bloody battle took place between strikers, private security agents, and the Pennsylvania State Police. The violence began after strikers boarded a trolley to search for scabs and they were confronted by an armed deputy, who opened fire. In the fighting that followed, between 12 and 26 people were killed.\n\nThe strike was settled on September 8th when Pressed Steel Car agreed to a wage increase, the posting of wage rates, and ended abuses in company housing practices. This labor dispute would be a precursor to the Great Steel Strike of 1919.",

Three were just eighteen years old.\n\nLed by Pastora, the Sandinistan forces captured the Palace while the legislature was in session, taking more than 1,000 hostages. The rebels demanded money, the release of Sandinistan prisoners, and, \"a means of publicizing the Sandinista cause\".\n\nAfter two days, the government agreed to pay $500,000 and release certain prisoners, marking a major victory for the FSLN.

He later became an author, publishing two novels with his own illustrations and a biography of the painter Matth\u0133s Maris.\n\nArondeus was active in the anti-Nazi resistance, helping forge documents to protect persecuted groups. A major obstacle to the success of this forgery was the Municipal Office for Population Registration, an Amsterdam office that contained millions of identifying records for Jews and others wanted by the Gestapo.\n\nArondeus and other members of the resistance bombed the office on March 27th, 1943, subduing the guards via injection, and succeeding in destroying approximately 800,000 documents. Arondeus was arrested on April 1st.\n\nAlthough he refused to give up the rest of his team, his notebook was found and a majority of the group was also arrested. On June 18th, Arondeus and fourteen others were tried and sentenced to death. Ardoneus pleaded guilty and took the full blame, which may have contributed to two members receiving clemency.\n\nBefore his execution, Arondeus made a point of ensuring the public would be aware that he and two other men in the group were gay, asking an acquaintance to \"Tell the people that homosexuals can be brave!\" Sometimes this quote is also translated as \"The people would know that gays are no cowards!\" or \"Tell the people that homosexuals are not by definition weak\".",

The riot took place in the context of severe police brutality and racial discrimination.\n\nAround noon on August 23rd, 1917, Lee Sparks and Rufus Daniels, two Houston police officers, disrupted a street gathering in Houston's predominantly-black San Felipe district by firing warning shots and then dragged and beat a woman dressed in her nightgown from her home.\n\nThey were then approached by Private Alonzo Edwards, who offered to take the woman into custody, however the police pistol-whipped and arrested him. When Corporal Charles Baltimore later asked the officers about the condition of Edwards, he was also pistol-whipped, shot at while fleeing, and then captured and beaten.\n\nWhen rumors of the brutality made it back to Camp Logan, 156 soldiers of the Third Battalion of the all-black Twenty-fourth U.S. Infantry Regiment mutinied and took up arms and marched into Houston, Texas. Police, thinking the black men couldn't arm themselves, only sent six officers out to meet the group, two of whom were killed immediately.\n\nBy the time the firing ceased, 17 people were dead: four police officers, nine civilians, and two soldiers. The next morning, Houston was placed under martial law. The remaining soldiers in the Twenty-fourth's camp were disarmed, and a house-to-house search uncovered a number of soldiers hiding within the San Felipe district. Soldiers in local jails were turned over to the Army, and the Third Battalion was sent by rail back to New Mexico.\n\nThe soldiers were tried at three courts-martial for mutiny. 19 were executed and 63 were sentenced to life imprisonment. Two white officers faced court-martial, but they were released. No white civilians were brought to trial.\n\nIn 1991, historian Calvin C. Smith noted that many of the sentenced were not conclusively identified as having even participated in the riot, despite repeated pledges of fair trials and absolute transparency from various political officials, including white supremacist U.S. President Woodrow Wilson.",

The Romanian military subsequently arrested other fascist government officials and joined in the Soviet Army's advance into Germany.\n\nAntonescu was tried and executed in 1946.

As the post-World War II economic boom in Nottingham began to subside, anti-immigrant sentiment increased.\n\nEyewitness accounts on the exact trigger of the violence differ, but nearly all cite a West Indian man being seen enjoying a drink with a blonde British woman.

Eight people were taken to the hospital, with one man requiring 37 stitches following a wound to the throat.\n\nDespite the racial character of the violence, government officials downplayed any role racism could have played in the incident. Chief Constable Athelstan Popkess dismissed claims that the rioting was caused by prejudice at the time, and a 1989 report from the Nottingham Constabulary blamed the violence on generic hooliganism.",

        "description": "On this day in 1927, Italian immigrant anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were executed by the U.S. government after they were dubiously convicted of murder, leading to international episodes of protest and violence.\n\nSacco, born in 1891, was a shoemaker and a night watchman, who migrated to the United States at the age of seventeen. Vanzetti was a fishmonger born on June 11th, 1888. Two men met at a strike in 1917.\n\nAfter a deadly shoe store robbery in 1919, both Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested. When searched by police, both denied owning any guns, but were found to be holding loaded pistols. Sacco was found to have an Italian passport, anarchist literature, and a loaded .32 Colt Model 1903 automatic pistol. Vanzetti had four 12-gauge shotgun shells and a five-shot nickel-plated .38-caliber Harrington & Richardson revolver. Despite this, both Sacco and Vanzetti had solid alibis for where they were during the murder.\n\nAnti-Italian and anti-anarchist sentiments played a significant role in their trial. Presiding Judge Thayer was an avowed enemy of anarchists. When giving his final statement in 1927, Vanzetti said \"I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.\"\n\nSacco and Vanzetti's arrest, trial, conviction, and execution became an international incident that caused an outrage among people of all political persuasions, not just anarchists. Among their advocates were Harvard law professor and future Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, who wrote that Judge Thayer's statement was \"a farrago of misquotations, misrepresentations, suppressions, and mutilations\",\n\nDespite international advocacy on their behalf, including rallies, sympathy strikes, and pleas for a re-trial, Sacco and Vanzetti's death sentences were not commuted. Vanzetti, in his final moments, shook hands with guards and thanked them for their kind treatment, read a statement proclaiming his innocence, and finally said, \"I wish to forgive some people for what they are now doing to me.\" Sacco was next and walked quietly to the electric chair, then shouted \"Farewell, mother.\"\n\nFollowing their execution, some radicals, including Italian anarchist Severino Di Giovanni, began a series of bombing campaigns, targeting Judge Thayer, a juror involved in the trial, Wall Street banks, and the American Embassy in Buenos Aires.\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of the executions, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis issued a proclamation that Sacco and Vanzetti had been unfairly tried and convicted and that \"any disgrace should be forever removed from their names\".",

        "description": "On this day in 1970, the largest U.S. farm worker strike in history, known as the \"Salad Bowl Strike\", began when field workers, organized with C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez and the United Farm Workers (UFW), struck, doubling the price of lettuce and costing sellers $500,000 a day.\n\nThe UFW had just won the Delano Grape Strike, which had lasted an astonishing five years, winning contracts with dozens of grape growers that were the first of their kind in agricultural history.\n\nThe origins of the Salad Bowl Strike lay in a jurisdictional dispute with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which had won the right to organize field workers after concluding a successful strike of drivers and packers in the lettuce producing sector in July.\n\nThe UFW strongly contested this claim, and, after negotiations broke down, between 5,000-7,000 field workers went on strike. The labor action was not just a strike, but also included mass pickets, boycotts, and secondary boycotts by the participants.\n\nThe price of lettuce almost doubled immediately, and the interruption to work cost lettuce growers approximately $500,000 a day. The strike was a bitter dispute which suffered violence and state repression. C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, a leading labor organizer, was jailed after refusing to stop the picketing on court order. On November 4th, 1970 a UFW regional office was bombed.\n\nThe strike ended on March 26th, 1971 when the Teamsters and UFW signed a new jurisdictional agreement reaffirming the UFW's right to organize field workers, however jurisdictional disputes between the UFW and Teamsters continued for years afterward. In 1975, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act (CALRA) became law, establishing the right to collective bargaining for farmworkers in that state, a first in U.S. history.",

He wrote over 20 books, including his best-selling and influential text \"A People's History of the United States\", the inspiration for this project.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) created a file on Zinn in 1949 due to his participation in organized labor. In the 1960s, as a result of Zinn's campaigning against the Vietnam War and his influence on Martin Luther King Jr., the FBI designated him a high security risk to the country by adding him to the Security Index, a list of American citizens who could be summarily arrested if a state of emergency was declared.\n\nFBI memos, released in 2010 after a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, also show that they were concerned with Zinn's repeated criticism of the FBI for failing to protect black people against white mob violence. Zinn's daughter said she was not surprised by the files - \"He always knew they had a file on him.\"\n\nZinn described himself as \"something of an anarchist, something of a socialist. Maybe a democratic socialist.\" He wrote extensively about the Civil Rights Movement, the anti-war movement and labor history of the United States. His memoir, \"You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train\" (Beacon Press, 2002), was also the title of a 2004 documentary about Zinn's life and work. Zinn died of a heart attack in 2010, at age 87.\n\n\"There is no flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people.\"\n\n- Howard Zinn",

        "description": "John Maclean, born on this day in 1879, was a revolutionary Scottish socialist and schoolteacher, sometimes called \"Scotland's Lenin\".\n\nMaclean's revolutionary politics were well-known, and in 1915, he was arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act and fired from his job as a primary school teacher. As a consequence, he became a full-time Marxist lecturer and organizer, educating other Glaswegian workers in Marxist theory.\n\nMaclean was also noted for his outspoken opposition to World War I, and, in 1918, he was arrested for sedition. During the trial, Maclean gave the now legendary \"speech from the dock\", expounding on his position. He was sentenced to five years' penal servitude, but was released after the November armistice.\n\nMaclean supported Irish independence on an anti-imperialist basis, describing the Irish War of Independence as \"The Irish fight for freedom\" and even condoning the assassination of a magistrate, Alan Bell.\n\nMaclean saw the war in Ireland as strengthening the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, arguing that \"Irish Sinn F\u00e9iners, who make no profession of socialism or communism...are doing more to help Russia and the revolution than all we professed Marxian Bolsheviks in Britain\".\n\nIn captivity, Maclean had been on hunger strike, and prolonged force-feeding permanently affected his health. In 1923, he collapsed during a speech and died of pneumonia, aged forty-four.\n\n\"I have taken up unconstitutional action at this time because of the abnormal circumstances and because precedent has been given by the British government. I am a socialist, and have been fighting and will fight for an absolute reconstruction of society for the benefit of all. I am proud of my conduct. I have squared my conduct with my intellect, and if everyone had done so this war would not have taken place...\n\n...I appeal exclusively to [the working class] because they and they only can bring about the time when the whole world will be in one brotherhood, on a sound economic foundation. That, and that alone, can be the means of bringing about a re-organisation of society. That can only be obtained when the people of the world get the world, and retain the world.\"\n\n- John MacLean, from the \"Dock Speech\"",

        "description": "Marsha P. Johnson, born on this day in 1945, was a civil rights activist, founding member of the Gay Liberation Front and the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.), and participant in the Stonewall Uprising of 1969.\n\nJohnson was one of the first drag queens to go to the Stonewall Inn after they began allowing women and drag queens inside; it was previously a bar for only gay men.\n\nOn the early morning hours of June 28th, 1969, the Stonewall uprising occurred. While the first two nights of rioting were the most intense, the clashes with police would result in a series of spontaneous demonstrations and marches through the gay neighborhoods of Greenwich Village for roughly a week afterwards.\n\nAccording to the New-York Historical Society, \"While there are many conflicting stories about the uprising\u2019s start, it is clear that Marsha was on the front lines. In one account, she started the uprising by throwing a shot glass at a mirror. In another, she climbed a lamppost and dropped a heavy purse onto a police car, shattering the windshield.\" After Stonewall, Johnson became more involved in activism, helping found the Gay Liberation Front.\n\nTo help provide a home for vulnerable trans youth, Marsha and her friend Sylvia Rivera together formed the Street Transvestite Activist Revolutionaries (STAR). The first STAR House was in the back of a seemingly abandoned truck in Greenwich Village, housing nearly 24 people.\n\nOne morning, they returned to the truck just as its driver was pulling away with STAR residents sleeping inside, who were then forced to jump from a moving vehicle. Marsha and Sylvia then rented and fixed up a dilapidated building to house STAR residents for eight months before being evicted.\n\nShortly after a pride parade in 1992, Johnson's body was discovered floating in the Hudson River. Police ruled the death a suicide, but Johnson's friends and other members of the local community insisted Johnson was not suicidal and noted that the back of Johnson's head had a massive wound.\n\nJohnson was cremated and, following a funeral at a local church, friends released her ashes over the river.\n\nThe 2012 documentary \"Pay It No Mind \u2013 The Life and Times of Marsha P. Johnson\" heavily features segments from a 1992 interview with Johnson, filmed shortly before her death.\n\n\"Darling, I want my gay rights now\"\n\n- Marsha P. Johnson",

        "description": "On this day in 1921, the first skirmishes of the Battle of Blair Mountain took place. Involving more than 10,000 armed workers battling with state and strikebreaking forces, it was the largest post-Civil War uprising and the largest labor uprising in U.S. history.\n\nThe conflict occurred in Logan County, West Virginia as part of the \"Coal Wars\", a series of early 20th-century labor disputes in Appalachia.\n\nFor five days, from late August to early September 1921, some 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3,000 lawmen and strikebreakers who were backed by coal mine operators during the miners' attempt to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields.\n\nSometimes the Battle's anniversary is marked as August 31st, when the miners' army clashed with armed forces marshaled by the county sheriff, coal companies, and state police in Logan County.\n\nThe battle ended on September 4th after approximately one million rounds had been fired, aerial bombardment of the miners, and the U.S. Army's intervention, acting on orders from President Harding.\n\nUp to 100 people were killed throughout the uprising. 985 miners were indicted for murder, conspiracy to commit murder, accessory to murder, and treason against the state of West Virginia. Though some were acquitted by sympathetic juries, others were imprisoned for several years.\n\nAccording to the Cultural Landscape Foundation, there has never been a complete archaeological survey of the battlefield. The West Virginia Mine Wars Museum is raising funds to sponsor a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) scan of the Nomination Area in order to identify the major zones of historical significance and promote the site's value as a historical park.",

More than half of the CTA's bus drivers were African-American and for weeks they had been fighting unfair union representation.\n\nLike many other protest movements in the 50s and 60s, the drivers took as their model the Montgomery bus boycott, organizing car pools and CTW \"courtesy cars\" to meet the transportation shortfall in some neighborhoods.\n\nAccording to Standish Willis, one of the striking drivers who later wrote a college thesis on the incident: \"Black drivers were being arrested while trying to close down the white stations, and we were losing what little money we had bailing them out of jail...White drivers at black stations respected the picket lines. The white drivers at the white ones did not.\"\n\nAccording to Willis, the strike's failure was due to the collective effort of establishment political powers working against the strike: \"With the police arresting our guys, the judges putting guys in jail and holding them for contempt, and the union threatening to kick our leaders out, it was a pretty concerted attack. And we certainly didn't have enough money to get people out of jail at the rate they were putting them in.\"",

Although the activists were able to speak with Governor Ridge, they were not successful in reversing the welfare reforms.\n\nThe KWRU continued to organize protests, holding that economic rights and the right to housing, education, food, and a living wage are human rights.",

        "description": "On this day in 1913, the Dublin Lock-Out began as hundreds of tram workers went out on strike, growing into one of most significant industrial disputes in Irish history. It involved ~20,000 workers and 300 colluding employers, and led to the founding of the Irish Citizen Army (ICA) to protect worker demonstrations.\n\nIn the years leading up to the strike, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU) had been seeking to unionize and radicalize the Irish workforce. Founded by socialist revolutionary James Larkin in 1908, the ITGWU was one of the first Irish unions that catered to both skilled and unskilled workers.\n\nIn July 1913, three hundred businesses (led by capitalist William Martin Murphy) agreed to not allow the ITGWU to unionize the Dublin workforce. Murphy dismissed hundreds of workers of suspected of union membership soon after.\n\nMany employers in Dublin then locked out their own employees, affecting tens of thousands of Irish workers, many of whom were already the poorest in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter outbreaks of violence between striking workers and strike-breakers occurred, James Connolly, Larkin and ex-British Army Captain Jack White formed a worker's militia, the Irish Citizen Army, to protect workers' demonstrations.\n\nThe lock-out concluded in early 1914, when the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in Britain rejected Larkin and Connolly's request for a sympathetic strike. Most workers, many of whom were on the brink of starvation, went back to work and signed pledges not to join the ITGWU, which was further weakened when Larkin fled to the United States and James Connolly was executed following the 1916 Easter Rising.\n\nMany of the blacklisted workers joined the British Army, having no other source of pay to support their families, and quickly found themselves in the trenches of World War I. ITGWU eventually recovered and gained strength after WWI; by 1920 the ITGWU was Ireland's largest union with 120,000 members, compared with its pre-war peak of 24,135 at the start of January 1913.",

The UMWA hired Sellins and, in 1919, sent her to the Allegheny River Valley district to direct picketing by striking miners at Allegheny Coal and Coke Company.\n\nOn August 26th, she witnessed guards attacking Joseph Starzeleski, a picketing miner who was being beaten to death. When Sellins intervened, deputies shot and killed her with four bullets and used a cudgel to fracture her skull.\n\nOthers said that she was attempting to protect miners' children that were on scene. Three deputies were indicted for the killings, but a 1923 trial ended in acquittal for the two men accused of her murder.",

The strike primarily took place in New York City, where 50,000 women gathered in protest. Thousands more protested in solidarity throughout the country, including in Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Washington D.C., and San Francisco.\n\nA key organizer of the protest was Betty Friedan, noted second wave feminist and then-president of NOW. The event had three primary goals: free abortion on demand, equal opportunity in the workforce, and free childcare. At the time, women made $.59 cents to every dollar a male counterpart made and many elite colleges did not yet admit women as students.\n\nAlthough the strike did not directly win any concessions, Congress declared August 26th \"Women's Equality Day\" the following year with the support of President Richard Nixon. The protest was a successful consciousness-raising event, with some feminist scholars claiming that the strike was a significant spark for second wave feminism.",

Black Hawk openly defied the U.S. government and attempted to reoccupy tribal lands along the Rock River in Illinois.\n\nOn August 2nd, the Massacre at Bad Axe (sometimes called the \"Battle of Bad Axe\") occurred when Sauk people attempted to surrender. Instead of accepting the surrender, American soldiers gunned them down indiscriminately.\n\nWomen carrying children on their backs attempted to swim across the Mississippi River to safety were shot at by soldiers. Many of those not shot to death drowned in the Mississippi waters.\n\nAlthough Black Hawk successfully fled the massacre, it was on this day in 1832 that he surrendered to the American government and was imprisoned.\n\nWhile detained by American forces, Black Hawk dictated his autobiography, published as \"Autobiography of Ma-Ka-Tai-Me-She-Kia-Kiak, or Black Hawk\".

The protests climaxed in what a major report later called a \"police riot\" on August 28th, 1968.\n\nIn defiance of explicit orders by the police, thousands of protesters attempted to march on the streets of Chicago. When they did so, they were \"attacked blitzkrieg fashion by busloads of club-swinging cops\" and beaten and arrested en masse. According to the New York Times, \"onlookers joined the protesters in booing the police. Rolls of toilet paper, bars of soap, and water glasses were thrown at the police from [Hilton] hotel windows, along with a number of rocks, bottles and cherry bombs\".\n\nMore than 600 people were arrested, and more than 100 protesters and cops were treated with injuries that night. So much tear gas was thrown that it could smelled from the hotel suite of Hubert Humphrey, who went on to win the presidential nomination that night.\n\nOn the convention floor, several delegates made statements against Mayor Daley and the CPD, like Senator Abraham Ribicoff who denounced the use of \"Gestapo tactics on the streets of Chicago\" in his speech nominating George McGovern. Subsequently, the \"Walker Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence\" assigned blame for the violence on the police force, calling the incident a \"police riot\".",

        "description": "Emmett Till was a black child tortured and lynched by white supremacists in Mississippi on this day in 1955, at 14 years old. His killers sold the story of how they murdered him for $4,000 after being acquitted by an all-white jury.\n\nEmmett was born in Chicago to Mamie Carthan, a working class woman from Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, where the average annual income for a black family was $462 (equivalent to $4,700 in 2016 dollars). In 1955, Till's great-uncle visited the family in Chicago and told Emmett stories about the Mississippi Delta, leading Emmett to plan a visit.\n\nTill arrived in Money, Mississippi, on August 21st, 1955. On the 24th, Till and his friends visited a store owned by a white couple. Till was accused of whistling at and approaching the wife, Carolyn Bryant, while at the store.\n\nFacts of Till's interaction with Bryant are disputed, however many of the accusations - that Till put his hands on Bryant, that he made lewd comments at her, or that he bragged to his friends about having had sex with a white woman - have been withdrawn by the people who initially made them. Till's mother has also stated that she taught Emmett to whistle to help with his stutter, which he developed after a bout with polio.\n\nAfter word broke out that an interaction had taken place between Till and Bryant, Carolyn's husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, J.W. Milam abducted Emmett, tortured him, shot him, and threw his corpse into the Tallahatchie River. Following Till's disappearance, civil rights activists Medgar Evers and Amzie Moore went undercover as cotton pickers to try and locate him.\n\nThree days after his abduction and murder, Till's swollen and disfigured body was found by two boys who were fishing in the Tallahatchie River. His head was very badly mutilated, he had been shot above the right ear, an eye was dislodged from the socket, there was evidence that he had been beaten on the back and the hips, and his body weighted by a fan blade, which was fastened around his neck with barbed wire.\n\nMamie decided to have an open-casket funeral, saying: \"There was just no way I could describe what was in that box. No way. And I just wanted the world to see.\" Tens of thousands of people lined the street outside the mortuary to view Till's body, and days later thousands more attended his funeral at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ.\n\nIn the lead-up to Bryant and Milam's trial, local newspapers falsely reported that there were riots at Till's funeral, and depicted both men smiling in military uniforms. On September 23rd, 1955, an all-white, all-male jury (both women and blacks had been explicitly banned) acquitted Bryant and Milam after a 67-minute deliberation. One juror said \"If we hadn't stopped to drink pop, it wouldn't have taken that long.\"\n\nProtected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam quickly struck a deal with \"Look\" magazine in 1956 to tell their story for approximately $4,000 ($35,000 in 2016 dollars).\n\nEmmett Till's murder became a flashpoint in the American civil rights movement; the Montgomery Bus Boycott began in December later that year after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white person. Parks stated \"I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back.\"\n\nMyrlie Evers, the widow of Medgar Evers, said in 1985 that Till's case resonated so strongly because it \"shook the foundations of Mississippi\u2014both black and white, because ... with the white community ... it had become nationally publicized ... with us as blacks ... it said, even a child was not safe from racism and bigotry and death.\"",

        "description": "Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, born on this day in 1825, was a German lawyer, journalist, political activist, and pioneering sexologist who scandalously came out publicly as gay in mid-19th century Germany.\n\nIn 1857, Ulrichs was fired from his job as an administrative lawyer for the district court of Hildesheim when his homosexuality was discovered. A few years later, he began publishing under his real name (sometimes cited as the first public \"coming out\" in modern Western society) and wrote a statement of legal and moral support for a man arrested for homosexual offenses.\n\nOn August 29th, 1867 Ulrichs became the first homosexual to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of German Jurists in Munich for a resolution urging the repeal of anti-homosexual laws. Although he was shouted down and no reform was passed, two years later the Austrian writer Karl-Maria Kertbeny coined the word \"homosexual\", and from the 1870s the subject of sexual orientation in the modern sense began to be widely discussed.\n\nIn Ulrichs' memory, the International Lesbian and Gay Law Association presents a Karl Heinrich Ulrichs Award for distinguished contributions to the advancement of sexual equality.\n\n\"Until my dying day I will look back with pride that I found the courage to come face to face in battle against the spectre which for time immemorial has been injecting poison into me and into men of my nature. Many have been driven to suicide because all their happiness in life was tainted. Indeed, I am proud that I found the courage to deal the initial blow to the hydra of public contempt.\"\n\n- Karl Ulrichs",

        "description": "On this day in 1830, the Swing Riots began, a widespread uprising initiated by English agricultural workers in protest of harsh working conditions and mechanization that was decreasing the number and quality of available jobs.\n\nThe riots began with the destruction of threshing machines in the Elham Valley area of East Kent in the summer of 1830, and by early December had spread through the whole of southern England and East Anglia, also destroying workhouses, tithe barns, ricks (hay bales), and maiming cows.\n\nHistorian J. F. C. Harrison concluded that the riots were overwhelmingly the result of the progressive impoverishment and dispossession of the English agricultural workforce over the previous fifty years.\n\nThe name \"Swing Riots\" was derived from the pseudonym \"Captain Swing\", often signed to the threatening letters sent to farmers, magistrates, parsons, and others. The term \"swing\" was apparently a reference to the swinging stick of the flail used in hand threshing, and Captain Swing was regarded as the mythical figurehead of the rebellion.\n\nThe Swing Riots were a major influence on the Whig Government and, as a part of a wider chain of social unrest, helped pressure the government to pass the Reform Act 1832, the \"Poor Law Amendment Act\" of 1834, which ended \"outdoor relief\" in cash or kind, and the setting up of a chain of workhouses covering larger areas across the country, to which the poor had to go if they wanted help.",

Originally built to house 400 inmates, in August of 1968, LBJ was crammed with 719 men. Despite representing 11% of the troops in Vietnam, more than 50% of the men incarcerated at the stockade were black.\n\nOn August 29th, 1968, just before midnight, a group of black inmates approached the administration building and attacked the guards there. Chaos erupted as other inmates joined the riot.\n\nSoldiers began to set fire to buildings using kerosene stolen from the prison supply, burning the mess hall, the barber shop, latrine, administration, and finance buildings. The rioters assaulted white inmates as well as guards. Despite the violence, only four inmates escaped and one prisoner was killed.\n\nOn the effect of the riot and his detention in it, veteran Jimmie Childress told National Public Radio \"I'm still angry about the way the military treated its own citizens. I still feel that something hand [sic] to be done...I guess I was just trying to prove that I was a human being. I'm over it now, but it took a long time. It took a long time.\"",

After the change in ownership, the union was retained, but some changes in management were instituted. While dancers had been regularly evaluated by managers before, now a peer review process was established wherein dancers evaluate each other. The team leaders were elected from among the dancers for six month terms.\n\nLusty Lady closed in 2013 due to a failure to negotiate rent prices with their landlord, Roger Forbes (of Deja Vu Consulting Inc., which owned many clubs in San Francisco).",

        "description": "Fred Hampton, born on this day in 1948, was a revolutionary socialist and chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, forming a class-based alliance known as the Rainbow Coalition before being assassinated by the Chicago PD.\n\nThe \"Rainbow Coalition\" included groups such as the Black Panther Party, the Young Patriots, the Young Lords, and worked together to organize against capital and broker peace treaties and alliances among Chicago street gangs.\n\nIn 1967, Hampton was identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a radical threat. The FBI tried to subvert his activities in Chicago, sowing disinformation among these groups and placing a counterintelligence operative in the local Panthers.\n\nIn December 1969, Hampton was assassinated during a predawn raid at his Chicago apartment by the Chicago Police Department. During the raid, Panther Mark Clark was also killed.\n\nAt a press conference the next day, the police announced the arrest team had been attacked by the \"violent\" and \"extremely vicious\" Panthers, and had defended themselves accordingly. In another press conference, police leadership praised the assault team for their \"remarkable restraint\" and \"professional discipline\" in not killing all the Panthers present.\n\nPhotographic evidence was presented of bullet holes allegedly made by shots fired by the Panthers, but this was soon challenged. Later, it was found that all but one of nearly one hundred shots were fired by the police.",

        "description": "On this day in 1979, actress Jean Seberg committed suicide after years of harassment, intimidation, and defamation by the FBI after she gave several donations to the Black Panther Party.\n\nJean Dorothy Seberg (1938 - 1979) was an American actress, supporter of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and target of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) \"COINTELPRO\" program.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Seberg provided financial support to various groups supporting civil rights, including the NAACP as well as Native American school groups such as the Meskwaki Bucks at the Tama settlement near her home town.\n\nThe FBI became aware of several gifts Seberg had made to the BPP, totaling just over $10k in contributions. The FBI operation against Seberg, directly overseen by J. Edgar Hoover, began to harass, intimidate, defame, and discredit her.\n\nThe FBI's stated goal was an unspecified \"neutralization\" of Seberg with a subsidiary objective to \"cause her embarrassment and serve to cheapen her image with the public\", while taking the \"usual precautions to avoid identification of the Bureau\". The FBI spread a false rumor about her pregnancy, claiming she was bearing the child of a BPP member, which was repeated frequently in the press. She was also effectively blacklisted from Hollywood films at this time.\n\nOn August 30th, 1979, Seberg committed suicide, writing \"Forgive me. I can no longer live with my nerves\". Romain Gary, Seberg's husband, called a press conference shortly after Seberg's death, publicly blaming the FBI's campaign against her for her deteriorating mental health.",

On this day in 1958, his force drove off a lynch mob with molotov cocktails. Here is what happened in Baron's own words:\n\n\"When they told us that they were coming to attack that night I went around and told all the people that was living in the area to withdraw that night. The women I told them to keep pots, kettles of hot water boiling, get some caustic soda and if anyone tried to break down the door and come in, to just lash out with them.\n\nThe men, well we were armed...Make no mistake, there were iron bars, there were machetes, there were all kinds of arms, weapons, we had guns. We made preparations at the headquarters for the attack. We had men on the housetop waiting for them...'Let's burn the niggers, let's lynch the niggers.' That's the time I gave the order for the gates to open...I says, 'Start bombing them.' When they saw the Molotov cocktails coming and they start to panic and run.\n\n...I knew one thing, the following morning we walked the streets free because they knew we were not going to stand for that type of behaviour.\"",

A speaker addressed them in front of the station, and the tension grew so high that when Joel Hunter, Chief Administrator of the Charities, asked for the selection of a committee to present the grievances of the crowd, there was a move to storm the station. A police squad arrived, and a general riot ensued.\"",

They surrendered peacefully after their demands were agreed to, however abuse continued afterward.\n\nThe HMP Hull is a Category B men's local prison located in Kingston upon Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England.\n\nOn August 31st, 1976, the first reports of what evolved into a prison-wide revolt emerged when a group of prisoners assembled, demanding to see a fellow inmate who was in the segregation unit. Claiming the man had been assaulted, the group staged a passive sit-in and blocked a prison officer from locking a door.\n\nThe protest escalated into destruction of prison property and outright rebellion. By the next day, inmates had control of two-thirds of the jail. Over the next four days, they caused \u00a34m worth of damage.\n\nThe rebelling prisoners made three demands: one, that the deputy regional director of prisons and chairman of the board of visitors and his deputy would be present at the surrender; two, that Irish prisoners would not be singled out for special treatment, they would all be treated the same as other prisoners; three, that prisoners wanted to be received by their own officers from Hull.\n\nThese demands, along with a promise to end brutality from guards, led to the prisoners' peaceful surrender on September 3rd. Upon re-entering the prison, however, many of the prisoners were severely beaten. Hull prison itself remained closed for a year, so extensive was the damage done to it.",

Participants formed an Interfactory Strike Committee (MKS), issuing 21 demands, including the acceptance of free trade unions independent of the Communist Party. These demands were agreed to by the state on August 31st in the Gda\u0144sk Agreement.\n\nSolidarity's membership peaked at 10 million in September 1981, representing one-third of the country's working-age population. The union organized the largest strike ever in the Soviet Bloc the same year, the \"Warning Strike\" - a four-hour general strike on March 27th involving millions of workers.\n\nSolidarity enjoyed considerable support from various anti-communist groups, including the CIA, the AFL-CIO, and even the U.S. Congress directly, which authorized the National Endowment for Democracy in 1983, allocating $10 million to the organization.\n\nSolidarity played a key role in Poland's liberalization. 1989 round table talks between the government and the Solidarity-led opposition produced an agreement for the 1989 legislative elections.\n\nBy the end of August, a Solidarity-led coalition government had formed and, in December 1990, Solidarity co-founder Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa was elected President of Poland and began privatizing the country's economy.

Realizing that the men needed help, he joined the Alabama Sharecroppers' Union in 1931.\n\nIn 1931, when the Communist Party arrived in Alabama, Cobb was impressed with them because he was saw the Party defending the Scottsboro Boys, nine young black men accused of raping two white women.\n\nIn December 1932, a sheriff tried to take the home and livestock of one of Cobb's friends. Cobb defended his friend and in turn was involved in a shootout in which he was wounded and arrested. Cobb was sentenced to thirteen years in jail.\n\nCobb was offered parole if he would agree to give up his farm and relocate to Birmingham. Instead, he served his full sentence and, after release in 1945, returned to his farm.\n\nCobb was one of the most successful black men in the highly Jim Crow-ed county and lived to the age of 89.

CPUSA provided legal aid to the Scottsboro Boys, helped poor Southern farmers form sharecropper unions, and promoted communist ideas within the U.S.\n\nThe party was established after a split in the Socialist Party of America following the Russian Revolution, and initially operated underground due to the Palmer Raids, a series of anti-immigrant, anti-labor, and anti-communist raids conducted by Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer.\n\nCPUSA was an early opponent of segregation and racial discrimination, giving legal aid to the Scottsboro Boys and helping poor black farmers in the South organize sharecropper unions. Because of this, the party had a strong presence in Alabama in the 1930s. This history is detailed in \"Hammer and Hoe: Alabama Communists during the Great Depression\" by historian Robin D.G. Kelley.\n\nDuring World War II, CPUSA's unwavering support for the Soviet Union alienated other factions of the American left, leading to a decline in membership. CPUSA membership was around 66,000 in 1939, and nearly 20,000 members left the party over the next four years, in part due to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviets and Nazi Germany, which compelled the party to back off militant anti-fascist rhetoric.\n\nIn 2008, CPUSA called the election of Barack Obama a \"transformative triumph of a labor-led all peoples' movement\". Although CPUSA does not run candidates under its own banner, its members do run for office - in 2019, CPUSA member Wahsayah Whitebird won a seat on the city council of Ashland, WI.",

        "description": "On this day in 1920, the first of many worker occupations and seizures of factories in Italy began, a movement that more than half a million workers participated in.\n\nDuring the month of September 1920, a widespread occupation of Italian factories by their workers took place. Although originating in the auto factories, steel mills, and machine tool plants of the metal sector, the occupation/revolt spread to cotton mills and hosiery firms, lignite mines, tire factories, breweries and distilleries, and steamships and warehouses in port towns. At its height, more than 600,000 workers were involved.\n\nThe worker rebellion was the culmination of years of labor strife - weeks before the occupations, the Italian Federation of Metallurgical Workers (FIOM), the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), and the General Confederation of Labor (CGL) called for \"obstructionism\" (essentially, a work slowdown) to be applied in all the engineering factories and shipyards starting on August 21st.\n\nBy the 24th, production at the Romeo factory in Milan had come to a complete standstill. A week later, production at the FIAT-Centro plant was reduced by 60%. On the morning of the 30th, the 2000 workers of the Romeo plant found the gates locked and the factory surrounded by troops. The FIOM responded by calling on its members to occupy the 300 engineering factories in Milan. Historian Lynn Williams describes what happened next:\n\n\"Between the 1st and 4th of September metal workers occupied factories throughout the Italian peninsula...the occupations rolled forward not only in the industrial heartland around Milan, Turin and Genoa but in Rome, Florence, Naples and Palermo, in a forest of red and black flags and a fanfare of workers bands...Within three days 400,000 workers were in occupation. As the movement spread to other sectors, the total rose to over half a million.\"\n\nAlthough some radical elements within the workers' movement (Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Syndicalist Union) called for revolution, referring to the occupations as \"an expropriating general strike\" and demanding total socialization of the economy, more moderate forces (the CGL) prevailed, using the pressure of the rebellion to cut a deal with employers, granting better conditions to the workers on the condition of returning to work.",

        "description": "Roger Casement, born on this day in 1864, was a human rights journalist and Irish revolutionary who exposed imperialist atrocities in the Congo and Peru. He was executed by the British for trying to raise military aid for the 1916 Easter Rising.\n\nCasement began his career working for Henry Morton Stanley and the African International Association, a front for King Leopold II of Belgium in his colonization of the Congo.\n\nIn 1890, Casement met Joseph Conrad, who had come to the Congo to pilot a merchant ship. According to author Liesl Schillinger, both were inspired by the idea that \"European colonisation would bring moral and social progress to the continent and free its inhabitants 'from slavery, paganism and other barbarities.' Each would soon learn the gravity of his error.\"\n\nIn 1904, he published the \"Casement Report\", which, via direct interviews with workers, overseers, and mercenaries, exposed the enslavement, mutilation, and torture of natives on the rubber plantations. The report caused an international scandal and led to various reform organizations in the West.\n\nA few years later, Casement traveled to the Putumayo District in South America, where the rubber was harvested deep in the Amazon Basin, and exposed the treatment of indigenous people in Peru. Finding conditions just as inhumane as what he witnessed in the Congo, Casement interviewed both the Putumayo and men who had abused them, publishing his findings in a first-person narrative that again caused an international scandal.\n\nIn November, 1914 Casement helped form the Irish Volunteers. He traveled to both the United States and Germany to promote the Irish nationalist cause and acquire aid for it.\n\nIn 1916, he was captured by the British government and charged with high treason. During trial proceedings, the government secretly circulated alleged excerpts from Casement's journals, exposing him as a homosexual. The authenticity of these documents is still debated today.\n\nCasement was hanged at Pentonville Prison on August 3rd, 1916 at 51 years old.\n\n\"Self government is our right, a thing born to us at birth a thing no more to be doled out to us by another people then the right to life itself then the right to feel the sun or smell the flowers or to love our kind.\"\n\n- Roger Casement",

Reuther survived two attempted assassinations, including one at home where he was struck by a 12-gauge shotgun blast fired through his kitchen window.\n\nReuther was an ally of MLK Jr. and C\u00e9sar Chavez, marching with the former on several occasions. A lifetime environmentalist, Reuther also played a critical role in funding and organizing the first Earth Day on April 22nd, 1970.\n\nDespite Reuther's advocacy for social justice, he did not seek systemic change. Socialist autoworker Beatrice Hansen had this to say of Reuther in 1955:\n\n\"Yes, Reuther, like the capitalists, is satisfied to live with things substantially as they are, instead of fighting to change things fundamentally, the way [Eugene V. ] Debs did. Reuther shrugged his shoulders after the Ford settlement and said, 'You never get everything.'\n\nWhat a far cry that is from Eugene Debs, whose mission it was to educate the workers so that they would not stop fighting and would not be satisfied until they had succeeded in forever wiping the system of wage exploitation from the face of the earth!\"\n\nReuther died in plane crash on May 9th, 1970, and when an inspection revealed that parts of the plane were installed incorrectly, some speculated he had been assassinated. Public intellectual Michael Parenti wrote \"Reuther's demise appears as part of a truncation of liberal and radical leadership that included the deaths of four national figures: President John Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, and Senator Robert Kennedy.\"\n\n\"There is no greater calling than to serve your fellow man. There is no greater contribution than to help the weak. There is no greater satisfaction than to have done it well.\"\n\n- Walter Reuther",

Marx called Georgism \"capitalism's last ditch\" and wrote \"theoretically [Henry George] is utterly backward!\u2026His fundamental dogma is that everything would be all right if ground rent were paid to the state.\"\n\nGeorge's writing was immensely popular in 19th century America. His most famous work, \"Progress and Poverty\" (1879), sold millions of copies worldwide, possibly more than any other American book before that time.\n\nThe text investigates the paradox of increasing inequality and poverty amid economic and technological progress, the cyclic nature of industrialized economies, and the use of rent capture such as land value tax and other anti-monopoly reforms as a remedy for these and other social problems.\n\n\"The great cause of inequality in the distribution of wealth is inequality in the ownership of land. The ownership of land is the great fundamental fact which ultimately determines the social, the political, and consequently the intellectual and moral condition of a people.\"\n\n- Henry George",

This immortal statement was made in the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776. In a broader sense, this means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, all the peoples have a right to live, to be happy and free.\n\n...Nevertheless, for more than eighty years, the French imperialists, abusing the standard of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, have violated our Fatherland and oppressed our fellow-citizens. They have acted contrary to the ideals of humanity and justice. In the field of politics, they have deprived our people of every democratic liberty...They have built more prisons than schools. They have mercilessly slain our patriots; they have drowned our uprisings in rivers of blood...They have robbed us of our rice fields, our mines, our forests, and our raw materials.\n\nFor these reasons, we, members of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, solemnly declare to the world that Vietnam has the right to be a free and independent country - and in fact is so already. The entire Vietnamese people are determined to mobilize all their physical and mental strength, to sacrifice their lives and property in order to safeguard their independence and liberty.\"",

        "description": "Jean Jaur\u00e8s, born on this day in 1859, was a leading French Socialist politician and outspoken critic of World War I. He was assassinated by a French nationalist at the war's outbreak.\n\nInitially a moderate republican, Jaur\u00e8s later became one of the first social democrats, eventually leading the French Socialist Party, which opposed Jules Guesde's revolutionary Socialist Party of France. The two parties merged in 1905 in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO).\n\nToday, a key aspect Jaur\u00e8s' legacy is his antimilitarism. Jaur\u00e8s was an early opponent of the draft and desperately tried to prevent war between France and Germany before World War I, going so far as to try and organize a general strike in both countries to force their leaders to negotiate diplomatically.\n\nIn 1914, Jaur\u00e8s returned to Paris from a diplomatic meeting in Brussels to advocate against the coming war. He was assassinated by a French nationalist at the outbreak of World War I, and remains a key historical figure of the French Left.\n\n\"Tradition does not mean to look after the ash, but to keep the flame alive.\"\n\n- Jean Jaur\u00e8s",

A 25 mile march in protest, led by Phillip Joiner, was attacked by a white lynch mob.\n\nThe \"Original 33\" were the first 33 African-American members of the Georgia General Assembly who were elected to office in 1868, during the Reconstruction era. They were among the first black state legislators in the United States. 24 of the members were ministers.\n\nAfter most of the legislators voted for losing candidates in the legislature's elections for the U.S. Senate, the white majority conspired to remove the black and mixed-ethnicity members from the Assembly.\n\nOn September 3rd, 1868, the Georgia legislators voted to expel all black members of the General Assembly (4 of the 33 were allowed to stay due to being 1/8 or less black).\n\nThe expelled members appealed to the federal government and state courts. In protest of the expulsion, former representative Phillip Joiner led a 25 mile march to Camilla, the county seat on September 19th.\n\nThere, the march was attacked by an armed white lynch mob, and approximately a dozen marchers were killed. The Camilla Massacre marked a new era of de facto voting discrimination and political disenfranchisement of the black population in Georgia.",

The union is aware of the devastating impact industrial action would have on the economy, which is largely a white man's economy with no benefits for poor black mineworkers.\"\n\n2013 was called \"The Year of the Strike\" by South African reporter Alec Hogg, with tens of thousands of auto manufacturing, agricultural, and construction workers also going on strike in the same year.",

        "description": "On this day in 1934, a strike involving 400,000 textile workers from all across the U.S. began, the largest strike in U.S. history at the time. Striking workers faced violence from the state, private guards, and deputized vigilantes.\n\nThe strike was national in scope - textile workers from New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, and the U.S. Southern states, all participated in the Textile Strike of 1934, which lasted twenty-two days.\n\nIn part due to the labor reforms of the Roosevelt administration, union membership had grown greatly in the months leading up to the strike. In February 1933, the United Textile Workers (UTW) had no more than 15,000 members. By June 1934, they had grown to 250,000 members, half of whom were cotton mill workers.\n\nOn September 3rd, thousands of workers took the streets in Gastonia, North Carolina to form a parade celebrating Labor Day. The next day, approximately 20,000 out of the 25,000 textile workers in the county were out on strike. Hundreds of thousands of textile workers across the country soon followed suit.\n\nStrikers faced violence from state police, private citizens, and private guards for the mills. South Carolina Governor Ibra Blackwood announced that he would deputize the state's \"mayors, sheriffs, peace officers and every good citizen\" to maintain order. Accordingly, dozens of protesting workers were killed as martial law was declared and private guards fired into crowds across the country.\n\nResults of the strike were mixed, but workers in the South fared particularly badly. Thousands of striking mill workers did not return to the mills and many were blacklisted. Some union officials claimed victory despite worker demands not being met.\n\nSouthern mill workers in particular were extremely bitter at the union and its officials for calling off the strike and putting their faith in government boards, when the employers had yet to concede anything.",

The strike was defeated and all participants fired, a failure one worker account blamed on union management.\n\nBritish Light Steel Pressings (BLSP) was a company at Warple Way, Acton, London producing bodies for the vehicle industry.\n\nA spate of 82 mainly unofficial strikes (i.e., \"wildcat\" strikes, taking place without union authorization) in 1961 caused the loss of over 27,000 man hours at the BLSP plant, which in turn caused the loss of 17,000 man hours at other plants owned by the BLSP parent company, \"Rootes\". The strike was chronicled by labor historian Ken Weller, who authored a pamphlet discussing the strike in detail, titled \"The B.L.S.P Dispute\".\n\nAccording to Weller, workers were unable to get union management to address their concerns about suspected upcoming layoffs. On September 4th, 1961, workers began a wildcat strike, walking off the job without union authorization.\n\nWeller states that the strike failed, undermined by the workers' own unions. Ultimately, all participating workers were fired, and the strike was broken.",

Four other civilians were also wounded. All of the victims were black and unarmed, and one, Ronald Madison, was mentally handicapped and shot in the back five times.\n\nThe NOPD attempted to cover-up the murders, falsely reporting that seven police officers responded to a police dispatch reporting an officer down, and that at least four suspects were firing weapons at the officers upon their arrival.\n\nAn attorney for the Justice Department described the case as \"the most significant police misconduct prosecution [in the U.S.] since the Rodney King beating case\". On April 20th, 2016, the five former officers pleaded guilty to various charges related to the shooting, and in return received reduced sentences ranging from three to twelve years.

        "description": "Claudette Colvin, born on this day in 1939, is a retired American nurse who was a pioneer of the 1950s civil rights movement, refusing to give up her bus seat to a white woman at age 15, nine months before Rosa Parks did the same.\n\nOn March 2nd, 1955, she was arrested at the age of fifteen in Montgomery, Alabama for refusing to give up her seat to a white woman on a crowded, segregated bus. This occurred nine months before the more widely known incident in which Rosa Parks, secretary of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), helped spark the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n\nFor many years, Montgomery's black leaders did not publicize Colvin's pioneering effort. She was an unmarried teenager at the time, and was reportedly impregnated by a married man. It is widely accepted that Colvin was not accredited by the civil rights campaigners at the time due to her pregnancy shortly after the incident, with even Rosa Parks saying \"If the white press got ahold of that information, they would have [had] a field day. They'd call her a bad girl, and her case wouldn't have a chance.\"\n\nColvin left Montgomery for New York City in 1958, because she had difficulty finding and keeping work following her participation in the federal court case that overturned bus segregation (similarly, Rosa Parks left Montgomery for Detroit in 1957). Colvin stated she was branded a troublemaker by many in her community. She withdrew from college and went on to become a nurse in Manhattan.\n\n\"My head was just too full of black history, you know, the oppression that we went through. It felt like Sojourner Truth was on one side pushing me down, and Harriet Tubman was on the other side of me pushing me down. I couldn't get up.\"\n\n- Claudette Colvin",

His death was claimed to be depicted in the photo \"The Falling Soldier\" (shown), but doubts have been raised about the photo's authenticity.\n\nFederico Borrell Garc\u00eda was born in Benilloba, Spain, and founded a local branch of the anarchist \"Iberian Federation of Libertarian Youth\" (FIJL). When the Civil War broke out, Garc\u00eda joined the local Loyalist militia, the Columna Alcoiana, and fought to defend the Spanish Republic against the Spanish Nationalist forces of Francisco Franco.\n\nOn September 5th, 1936, Borrell was one of about fifty men who arrived at Cerro Muriano in C\u00f3rdoba to reinforce the militia against Francoist forces commanded by General Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela.\n\nBorrell was fatally shot around five o'clock on or near the hill known as La Loma de las Malague\u00f1as. He was identified as the man in the photo by his brother, corroborated by the fact that Spanish government records state he was the only member of the Columna Alcoiana to die in the fighting that day.\n\nThe claim that Garc\u00eda is the man in the photo has been disputed, with at least one documentary, \"La Sombra del Iceberg\" (2007), claiming that the picture was staged and that Garc\u00eda is not the individual in the picture.",

The trial was unusual in the way that the prosecution did not try to demonstrate the guilt of individuals, but rather to indict the IWW as a whole, reading inflammatory passages from seized documents. Accordingly, the defense testified about the plight of the working man and the evils of capitalism.\n\nAll defendants were found guilty on all charges brought by the prosecution, and many IWW members served several years in prison. Among those convicted was \"Big Bill\" Haywood, a well-known leader of the IWW, however he skipped bail before his sentencing and fled to the Soviet Union, where he would spend the rest of his life.",

The revolt was not well-taken in the press.\n\nThe Irish Times wrote \"To-day Irish Labour is permeated with a spirit of revolt against all the principles and conventions of ordered society.

His fellow activists did not want to do anything risky, however, so Tsafendas decided to kill Verwoerd instead, viewing him as the \"brains\" behind the policy of apartheid.\n\nOn September 6th, 1966, Tsafendas approached Prime Minister Verwoerd as he was approaching his seat in Parliament, drew a concealed sheath knife from his belt, and stabbed him about four times in the torso before he was pulled away by other members of parliament.\n\nTsafendas was taken into police custody, where he was severely beaten, and then moved to a hospital where he was treated for his injuries and interviewed by a psychiatrist. Throughout his time in custody, Tsafendas was subjected to severe torture from beatings, electric shocks, mock hangings, and pretended defenestrations.\n\nAt his trial, he was declared not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. His political motivations were concealed from the proceedings. The court ordered for him to be detained \"at the pleasure of the State President\", which meant that only the State President (later President) had the authority to order his release.\n\nHe was never discharged and tortured in custody, dying at the age of eighty-one while still in prison.

The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) engaged in direct action multiple times to fight for their rights as workers.\n\nOn July 11th, 2011, leaders of the ILWU (alongside other dock workers) were arrested for occupying the Port of Longview's huge new, ultra-automated grain terminal, a $200 million dollar facility that was scheduled to soon begin testing operations with non-union labor.\n\nOn September 7th, 2011, a massive picket line of some 700 longshoremen and their supporters blocked a grain train from entering EGT's (a large shipping conglomerate) terminal. When cops started pepper spraying, the picketers pushed back. ILWU McEllrath stepped forward amidst the chaos and was immediately arrested, although he was soon released after hundreds of workers surrounded police officers.\n\nLongshoremen from the major Northwest ports, Seattle, Tacoma and Portland, seeing images of the ILWU president being manhandled by cops, stopped work and began destroying EGT property. According to news reports, the cyclone fence was torn down, grain was dumped from the train cars, and the terminal was briefly occupied by angry longshore workers.",

The union was formed in 1931 at a time where many trade organizations were more similar to social undertakings than an industrial movement.\n\nImoudu was released from prison by the government in 1945, presumably as a means to de-escalate labor tensions. A large rally was held to welcome him back to Lagos, however, and, on the 21st and 22nd of June 1945, Imoudu led a radical wing of the RWU to organize a general strike that became a historically important in Nigeria.",

His leadership style was aggressive, and the relatively moderate American Federation of Labor (AFL) sought to undermine his influence in the strike, although their efforts failed due to worker loyalty to Gold.\n\nAlthough the strike was ultimately successful due to Gold's efforts, the AFL expelled him, accusing Gold and other strike leaders of debauchery, wasting union money, bribery, forcing workers to join the Communist Party, among other grievances. Despite this, he remained a powerful figure within the organized labor of the fur industry, often competing directly with AFL-backed unions for influence among workers.\n\nGold was also a victim of anti-communist purges on many occasions. In 1950, Gold resigned from the Communist Party and signed an anti-communist oath related to the Taft-Hartley Act. The Justice Department argued that Gold had not really resigned, and indicted him for perjury in August 1953 one day before the statute of limitations ran out.\n\nAlthough he was successfully convicted, Gold managed to get the conviction overturned on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court (Gold v. United States) and all charges were dropped.",

During the strike, labor groups involved merged to form the landmark United Farm Workers (UFW).\n\nThe Delano Grape Strike was organized by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), a predominantly Filipino and AFL-CIO-sponsored labor organization, against table grape growers in Delano, California to fight against the exploitation of farm workers.\n\nThe strike began on September 8th, 1965 and was soon joined by the National Farmworkers Association (NFWA). The labor action lasted for an astonishing five years and was characterized by its grassroots tactics - consumer boycotts, marches, community organizing and nonviolent resistance - which achieved national attention.\n\nFilipino strike leader Andy Imutan noted that growers used race as a means to divide workers, writing: \"The struggle became a lot harder when Mexican workers started crossing our picket lines. There was no unity between the Mexicans and the Filipinos. The growers were very successful in dividing us and creating conflict between the two races...So Larry Itliong and I decided to take action by seeing Cesar Chavez, the leader of the National Farm Workers Association...It took several discussions and a lot of faith, but finally the Filipinos and Mexicans joined as one on September 16th to picket the Delano growers.\"\n\nIn July 1970, strikers finally achieved a collective bargaining agreement with major table grape growers, affecting more than 10,000 farm workers. In August 1966, the AWOC and the NFWA merged to create the United Farm Workers (UFW) Organizing Committee.\n\nThe Delano Grape Strike is notable for the effective implementation and adaptation of boycotts, the unprecedented partnership between Filipino and Mexican farm workers to unionize farm labor, and the creation of the UFW labor union, all of which revolutionized the farm labor movement in America.",

According to one eye-witness account, nearly three hundred were arrested.\n\nAfter the milk strike, the Norwegian Confederation of Unions underwent \"Nazification\", with members of the Fascist party \"Nasjonal Samling\" installed as leaders. The Nazification also applied to other parts of a civil society - the Oslo police chief, the future Prime Minister, and many university staff were also arrested in the aftermath of the strike.\n\nThe executions of Hansteen and Wickstr\u00f8m became lasting symbols of the Norwegian anti-fascist resistance.",

The conditions of the prison were extremely overcrowded, with the population around 2,243 - more than double of the facility's designed limit of 1,200.\n\nHistorian Howard Zinn described the conditions at the prison this way: \"Prisoners spent 14 to 16 hours a day in their cells, their mail was read, their reading material restricted, their visits from families conducted through a mesh screen, their medical care disgraceful, their parole system inequitable, racism everywhere.\"\n\nOn the morning of September 9th, 1971, fighting broke out between inmates and prison officers, leading to ~1,200 prisoners to control about half of the facility by noon. One officer involved died of his injuries two days later, and inmates took 42 hostages and began drafting a set of demands to be met before they would surrender.\n\nPrisoners met with the press, and a 21-year old speaker, Elliot \"L.D.\" Barkley, delivered a \"Declaration to the People of America\" the same day inmates seized control of the prison.\n\nAfter four days of fruitless negotiations and escalating tensions between prisoners and police, Gov. Nelson Rockefeller (who refused to come to the scene in person) ordered that the prison be retaken by force. 39 people, mostly inmates, were killed in a 15-minute assault by state police, including Barkley.\n\n\"We are men! We are not beasts and we do not intend to be beaten or driven as such. The entire prison populace, that means each and every one of us here, have set forth to change forever the ruthless brutalization and disregard for the lives of the prisoners here and throughout the United States. What has happened here is but the sound before the fury of those who are oppressed. We will not compromise on any terms except those terms that are agreeable to us. We've called upon all the conscientious citizens of America to assist us in putting an end to this situation that threatens the lives of not only us, but of each and every one of you, as well.\"\n\n- Declaration to the People of America, Read by Elliott James \"L.D.\" Barkley, September 9th, 1971",

Her activities were in the trade union field and she was part of the Socio-pedagogical Missions, an initiative launched by the lecturers from the Co-operative Rural Education Institute.\n\nIn 1976, Quinteros was arrested by the military dictatorship. While being escorted by her captors, Quinteros suddenly jumped over the wall of the Venezuelan Embassy, calling out her name and asking for sanctuary. The embassy staff attempted to help her, but her captors managed to thwart the escape.\n\nA few days later, she was tortured and killed. Her kidnapping and murder grew into a major diplomatic incident that eventually culminated in Venezuela cutting off diplomatic relations with Uruguay.\n\nIn October 2002, Judge Eduardo Cavalli found former minister Juan Carlos Blanco primarily responsible for the disappearance of Elena Quinteros and had him arraigned on charges of deprivation of liberty.",

The group often practices a form of symbolic protest that involves the damaging of weapons and military property, taking its name from the idea of beating swords to plowshares (converting means of violence into peaceful tools) from the Book of Isaiah.\n\nThe movement's first act happened on September 9th, 1980, when eight activists entered the General Electric Re-entry Division building (where missiles and military vehicles were made), smashed the cones of two warheads with hammers, poured their own blood on documents, and prayed for peace.\n\nKnown as the \"Plowshare Eight\", they were arrested and charged with more than ten different felony and misdemeanor counts. Plowshare acts of civil disobedience continue into the modern day, with a widow of one of the original eight, Elizabeth McAlister, getting arrested in 2018 for direct action at Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base.",

Around 50 slaves and 25 militiamen were killed in the fighting.\n\nThe Stono Rebellion was directly responsible for the \"Negro Act of 1740\", which required a ratio of one white person to ten black on any plantation, also prohibiting slaves from growing their own food, assembling in groups, earning money, and learning to read.",

On the other side of the river was the beach resort known officially as \"Le Touquet-Paris-Plage\". Le Touquet was, in effect, officers' territory, and pickets were stationed on the bridge over the Canche to enforce this.\n\nOn September 9th, 1917, Gunner A. J. Healy, who had been walking along the river at low tide, attempted to return across the bridge. He was apprehended by the guards and accused of being a deserter.\n\nUpon hearing this, soldiers from the camp formed an angry mob and moved towards the town, failing to disperse even after being told that Healy had been released. His arrest had become the catalyst for open rebellion after years of soldiers' discontent.\n\nThe soldiers clashed with police, who shot openly into the crowd, killing one soldier and wounding a French bystander. Open mutiny continued for days before being put down by force and mass arrests on September 12th.\n\nCorporal Jesse Short was convicted of attempted mutiny and executed by firing squad. Many other soldiers received lesser punishments, ranging from demotion in rank and fines to as many as ten years in prison.\n\nAccording to freelance author David Lamb, the \u00c9taples Mutiny was part of a rising tide of British mutinies which continued throughout 1918, reaching a peak in the winter of 1918 - 1919. Military police fired on strikers and mutineers, killing at least 27 in the month of September 1917 alone.",

By the end of the night, two people were killed and twenty-eight were injured.\n\nFaced with the possibility of losing a lucrative government contract, Tetzlaff capitulated to the demands of a 40 hour work week, 25 cents per hour wage, and overtime pay to the workers, although he still refused to recognize the union.",

When the war ended in March 1939, she and Mesa got on to a truck for Almeria to catch a ship for Algeria, but was imprisoned in the infamous Francoist concentration camp of Albatera, where 25,000 people were murdered by the Francoists and thrown into mass graves.\n\nAfter escaping Albatera, along with Isabel Mesa, she set up a newspaper kiosk in Valencia which secretly distributed the anarchist press. In 1942 with Isabel and others, she set up the underground group the Union of Democratic Women (UMD) to help prisoners and their families.\n\nIn 1955, Sanchez was arrested because of her anarchist activities. After the death of Franco, she was actively involved in the reconstruction of the CNT and supported the creation of the free radio station Radio Klara. In 1997, she also contributed to the anarchist journal \"El Chico\".",

He died the same day of a gunshot wound to the head, later ruled a suicide.\n\nAllende was a Chilean socialist politician and physician, President of Chile from 1970 until 1973, and head of the Popular Unity political coalition government; he was Latin America's first ever Marxist to be elected president in a liberal democracy.\n\nAs president, Allende sought to nationalize major industries, expand education and improve the living standards of the working class. He clashed with the right-wing parties that controlled Congress and with the judiciary.\n\nOn September 11th, 1973, the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'\u00e9tat assisted by the Henry Kissinger and the CIA. As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, he gave his last speech vowing not to resign. Later that day, Allende died of a gunshot wound, which the new government claimed was self-inflicted. Although this conclusion was supported by later investigations, speculations of Allende being murdered continue to this day.\n\nFollowing Allende's death, General Augusto Pinochet refused to return authority to a civilian government, and Chile would be ruled by a military junta until 1990. This junta dissolved the Congress of Chile, suspended the Constitution, and began a persecution of alleged dissidents, in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed.",

The goal of the conflict was to attain independence for both Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde.\n\nCabral was assassinated on January 20th, 1973 (likely by a Portugal-backed assassin) about eight months before Guinea-Bissau's unilateral declaration of independence.

He was a major figure in the ten-year Guatemalan Revolution, which represented some of the few years of representative democracy in Guatemalan history.\n\n\u00c1rbenz instituted many popular reforms, including an expanded right to vote, the right of workers to organize, legitimizing political parties, and allowing public debate.\n\nThe centerpiece of \u00c1rbenz' policy was an agrarian reform law, under which uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree, the majority of them indigenous people whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion.\n\nOpposition to these policies led the United Fruit Company to lobby the U.S. government to have him overthrown. The U.S. was also concerned by the presence of communists in the Guatemalan government, and \u00c1rbenz was ousted in a coup d'\u00e9tat engineered by the U.S. government on June 27th, 1954.\n\n\"Our only crime consisted of decreeing our own laws and applying them to all without exception. Our crime is having enacted an agrarian reform which effected the interests of the United Fruit Company. Our crime is wanting to have our own route to the Atlantic, our own electric power and our own docks and ports. Our crime is our patriotic wish to advance, to progress, to win economic independence to match our political independence. We are condemned because we have given our peasant population land and rights.\"\n\n- Jacobo \u00c1rbenz",

In 1930, she opened a clinic in Harlem, staffed with black doctors, by securing funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund.\n\nSanger did not tolerate bigotry among her staff, nor would she tolerate any refusal to work within interracial projects. The clinic was publicized in the African-American press and churches, and it received approval from W.E.B. Du Bois. Sanger's efforts were also later lauded by MLK Jr.\n\nAlthough Sanger rejected racist bigotry, she did endorse the ableism of the then-popular eugenics movement, writing in 1921 that \"the most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective\".\n\n\"Birth control is the first important step woman must take toward the goal of her freedom. It is the first step she must take to be man's equal. It is the first step they must both take toward human emancipation.\"\n\n- Margaret Sanger",

In October, some workers began flinging mud and destroying factory fences with axes, presumably to scare off some scabs that had replaced them. This behavior scandalized the strike and damaged some public support of it.\n\nThe strike was initially unsuccessful, but, following a similar strike in 1848, a law was passed limiting the working day to 10 hours.

        "description": "On this day in 2016, a general strike on the island of Curacao took place in support of striking contract workers at the oil refinery Isla. The strike caused massive power outages, affecting 80% of the island; workers won by the next day.\n\nRefinery workers had been striking unsuccessfully for more than a week, demanding a lump sum of 3,000 guilders (USD $1500) as compensation for the years in which the employers did not compensate their pay for inflation.\n\nOn September 13th, seventeen unions and two trade union federations wrote a letter to the Governor in support the strikes, including the demand of the lump sum. That afternoon, former minister and union leader Errol Cova announced a general strike that would begin on September 15th.\n\nOn that day, the general strike began, causing massive power outages that affected up to 80% of the island. The lack of air conditioning in the hot climate was frustrating for both locals and tourists.\n\nBy the next day, the workers won their demands, including the lump sum, in total 1.8 million guilders for union members. Despite the widespread labor action, there were no reports of rioting or violence according to the Curacao Chronicle.",

        "description": "On this day in 1978, United Steelworkers union workers in Sudbury, Ontario voted to go on strike to fight proposed layoffs and pay cuts. The strike was the longest in Canadian history until the record was broken by Sudbury workers in 2009.\n\nThe layoffs and cuts to pay and benefits were at the multi-national company Inco, which cited low nickel prices as a justification.\n\nAccording to filmmaker Martin Duckworth, workers voted to strike against the advice of the United Steelworkers hierarchy, and the strike enjoyed national support because Inco was a known polluter and one of the biggest multi-nationals in Canada.\n\nAround 11,600 workers were involved in the strike, which affected the wages sustaining 43,000 people, or about 26% of the population of metropolitan Sudbury. By the end of the strike, nine months later, the company had been deprived of over twenty-two million hours of labor.\n\nThe workers won small wage increase and a pension package, however thousands of workers lost their homes and cars because of the length of the strike. According to journalist Amy Miller, since 1979, INCO has fired 20,000 employees from their staff and now have more people receiving payments from the pension roll than pay roll.\n\nThe role of women in the community during the strike was profiled in the 1980 documentary film A Wives' Tale (Une histoire de femmes).",

        "description": "On this day in 1931, the Invergordon Mutiny began when 1,000 sailors of the British Atlantic Fleet rebelled in response to widespread pay cuts. The mutiny caused an economic panic which forced the government off the Gold Standard.\n\nThe widespread pay cuts were brought by the British government as part of its attempts to deal with the Great Depression. In the Navy, these cuts manifested as a 10% pay cut for officers and senior ratings and a 25% cut for ratings below petty officer who had joined before 1925.\n\nOn the morning of September 15th, sailors on four capital ships due to sail had began disobeying orders. On the Hood and the Nelson, crews carried out the ordinary harbor routine, refusing to put to sea (leave land for a voyage); on the Valiant and the Rodney, crews carried out only essential duties, including the provision of safety patrols and fire guards, and did so without any recourse to their officers.\n\nBy the second day, the government began walking the pay cut policies back, with the lower ranked members now only receiving a 10% pay cut. A number of the strike organizers were jailed and 397 sailors were discharged from the Navy in the uprising's aftermath.\n\nThe mutiny inspired widespread working class resistance. Socialist Review magazine notes that, in the wake of the Invergordon uprising, massive demonstrations against wage cuts and unemployment took place. On September 21st, the British government walked back pay cuts for teachers and policemen following a massive domestic demonstration.\n\nOn October 7th, the National Unemployed Workers' Movement led a riot of 50,000 unemployed in Glasgow. The next day, 30,000 did likewise in Manchester, followed by another demonstration of 60,000 in Glasgow. The offices of the Communist Party's Daily Worker were raided and and staff arrested after they expressed support to the mutineers.\n\nThe mutiny caused a panic on the London Stock Exchange and a run on the pound, bringing Britain's economic troubles to a head and forcing it off the Gold Standard.",

Schumann was later to be executed by the Nazis in 1945.\n\nIn 1920, after the right-wing Kapp Putsch, Hoelz organized workers from Falkenstein and Oelsnitz in a Red Guard, leading armed bands against the police, the army, and the far-right paramilitary Freikorps. In this role, he became Robin Hood-like figure, raising money from employers under threat of reprisals, liberating prisoners, destroying property deeds and police archives, and burning villas of the rich.\n\nLater in life, after the Nazis began to come into power, Hoelz moved to Soviet Russia, however he became a dissident, critical of bad working conditions. On September 15th, 1933, he died in a boating accident, which anarchist historian Nick Heath claimed was actually an NKVD assassination.",

Here is an excerpt of his testimony:\n\nSACB: \"Did you have any understanding, Mr. Morgan, before you went to Spain, of what the issues were connected to that war?\"\n\nMorgan: \"I felt that I had a pretty good idea of what fascism was and most of its ramifications. Being aware of what the Fascist Italian government did to the Ethiopians, and also the way that I and all the rest of the Negroes in this country have been treated ever since slavery, I figured I had a pretty good idea of what fascism was...\"\n\nSACB: \"Mr. Morgan, were those thoughts in your mind before you went to Spain?\"\n\nMorgan: \"Ever since I have been big enough to understand things I have rebelled. As a small child of three or four years old I would rebel at human injustice in the way I understood it at that age. And as long as I have been able to remember, up until now, the government and a lot of people have treated me as a second-class citizen. I am 43 years old, and all my life I have been treated as a second-class citizen, and naturally if you always have been treated like one you start feeling it at a very tender age.\n\nWith Hitler on the march, and fascism starting the fight in Spain, I felt that it could serve two purposes: I felt that if we cold lick the Fascists in Spain, I felt that in the trend of things it would offset a bloodbath later. I felt that if we didn't lick Franco and stop fascism there, it would spread over lots of the world. And it is bad enough for white people to live under fascism, those of the white people that like freedom and democracy. But Negroes couldn't live under it. They would be wiped out.\"",

She was highly critical of the existing political system in Japan, which led her to call for an anarchism to exist in \"everyday practice\", namely that people should in various small ways seek routinely to undermine the kokutai (a sense of national body politic). It\u014d also translated anarchist writings into Japanese, including works of Emma Goldman.\n\nOn September 16th, 1923, It\u014d, \u014csugi, and his 6-year-old nephew Munekazu were arrested, strangled to death, and thrown into an abandoned well by a squad of military police known as the \"Kenpeitai\".\n\nThe killing of such high-profile anarchists, together with a young child, became a national controversy known as the \"Amakasu Incident\" (named after the leader of the squad).

During her time there, Fish-Harnack became interested in the Soviet Union and communist thought.\n\nIn her lectures, Fish-Harnack encouraged her students to use Karl Marx as a \"practical solution to the evils of the present\". Amid financial difficulties at Berlin University and the rising Nazi movement, Mildred was let go from her teaching position in 1932.\n\nTogether with her husband, in 1932 Fish-Harnack formed a left-wing group that regularly met to discuss and debate contemporary political ideas. From these meetings arose a key part of the \"Red Orchestra\", a loose collective of anti-fascists committed to resisting the Nazi government during World War II.\n\nBeginning in 1940, the group was in contact with Soviet agents in an attempt to thwart the forthcoming German attack upon the Soviet Union. Mildred herself even sent the Soviets information about the planned invasion, codenamed Operation Barbarossa.\n\nFollowing the capture of German communist and Soviet collaborator Johann Wenzel, Nazi police were able to decipher Red Orchestra messages. On September 7th, Arvid and Mildred Fish-Harnack were arrested while on a weekend outing. Both were executed in custody.\n\nMildred's last words were purported to have been: \"Ich habe Deutschland auch so geliebt\" (\"I loved Germany so much as well\").

        "description": "*sources provide conflicting birth years - the one listed is provided by Encyclopedia Britannica\n\nRicardo Flores Mag\u00f3n, born on this day in 1873, was a noted Mexican anarchist and social reform activist. Followers of the Flores Mag\u00f3n brothers (including Enrique and Jesus) were known as Magonistas. In 1911, the Magonistas controlled Tijuana and Mexicali for about six months as part of the \"Magonista Uprising\" against the state.\n\nDrawing upon the influences of early anarchist writers, such as Kropotkin, Bakunin, Goldman, and others, Ricardo was one of the major thinkers of the Mexican Revolution and the Mexican revolutionary movement in the Partido Liberal Mexicano.\n\nFlores Mag\u00f3n organized with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and edited the Mexican anarchist newspaper \"Regeneraci\u00f3n\". He has been considered an important participant in the social movement that sparked the Mexican Revolution.\n\nAfter his works were banned in Mexico, Ricardo fled to the United States, where he would remain for the rest of his life. Arrested multiple times, his final arrest came he was charged and convicted with sedition under the Espionage Act of 1917, and he was sentenced to twenty years for \"obstructing the war effort\", a violation of the Act.\n\nMag\u00f3n died at Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas, and speculation remains today about whether he died of natural causes or was murdered by prison guards.",

Printed in red ink on white paper, they said: \"Remember, we will not tolerate any longer. Free the political prisoners, or it will be sure death for all of you.\" At the bottom, the flyers were signed \"American Anarchist Fighters\".",

This led to an uprising of new sounds in popular music during the administration of President Salvador Allende.\n\nJust a few days after the U.S.-backed coup that ousted Allende from power, Jara was arrested, tortured, and killed by the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Guards smashed his fingers and mockingly asked him to play guitar; Jara responded by singing \"Venceremos\", which begins:\n\nFrom the deep crucible of the homeland\n\nThe people's voice rises up\n\nThe new day comes over the horizon\n\nAll Chile breaks out in song.\n\nJara is one of many \"desaparecidos\" - people who vanished under the Pinochet government and were most likely tortured and killed.\n\nThirty-six years after his first burial, Jara received a full funeral on December 3rd, 2009 in Santiago. On July 3rd, 2018, eight retired Chilean military officers were sentenced to 15 years in prison for Jara's murder, as well as the killing of his communist associate and former Chilean prison director Littre Quiroga Carvajal.\n\nIn 1969, Jara stated: \"The cultural invasion is like a leafy tree which prevents us from seeing our own sun, sky and stars. Therefore in order to be able to see the sky above our heads, our task is to cut this tree off at the roots. US imperialism understands very well the magic of communication through music and persists in filling our young people with all sorts of commercial tripe. With professional expertise they have taken certain measures: first, the commercialization of the so-called 'protest music'; second, the creation of 'idols' of protest music who obey the same rules and suffer from the same constraints as the other idols of the consumer music industry \u2013 they last a little while and then disappear. Meanwhile they are useful in neutralizing the innate spirit of rebellion of young people. The term 'protest song' is no longer valid because it is ambiguous and has been misused. I prefer the term 'revolutionary song'.\"",

In 1947, he moved to Portugal to study, where he would be arrested for participating in political demonstrations. Following protests demanding his release, he was placed under house arrest, which he escaped.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1974, Neto would move across the world, covertly directing the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola's (MPLA) guerilla war against the Portuguese colonizers. Following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, Angola was granted independence, to be led by a coalition of different anti-colonial groups. This coalition quickly fell apart, with Angola erupting into a civil war in 1975.\n\nDeclaring a Marxist-Leninist state, Neto was elected President of the People's Republic of Angola at the MPLA's first party congress in 1975. He died while undergoing surgery for liver cancer in 1979 at the age of 57.\n\n\"Our contribution has to be given not only for the liquidation of the colonial system but also for the liquidation of ignorance, disease and primitive forms of social organization.\"\n\n- Agostinho Neto",

Another video showed multiple guards sodomizing a prisoner with police batons and a broomstick.\n\nThat evening, thousands of Georgians took to the streets in protest of the abuse.

He and his father were both members of the Piraeus metal union. Pavlos had been active hip hop since 1997 and is well-known for his left-wing, anti-fascist lyrics.\n\nOn September 18th, 2013, Fyssas was fatally stabbed by Giorgios Roupakias, a member and employee of the neo-fascist party Golden Dawn. Following his death, there were a series of protests and rallies against Golden Dawn throughout Europe.\n\nDuring one protest in Athens, attended by 2,500-10,000 people, anti-fascists began marching towards Golden Dawn's central offices and were arrested and beaten by police. On November 1st, 2013, a shooting took place at the Golden Dawn's Neo Irakleio offices in Athens, killing two members.\n\nIn October 2020, sixty-eight members of Golden Dawn were declared part of a criminal organization, and fifteen were convicted in charges relating to Pavlos' murder.\n\nWhen asked about Pavlos' character by Al Jazeera, his mother stated \"You're asking a mother about what kind of a person her son was. He was a free man.\"\n\n\"The world has become a big prison\n\nand I'm looking for a way to break the chains\n\n...\n\nLet them come and find me at the mountain top, I'm waiting for them and I will not bother with fear.\"\n\n- Pavlos Fyssas",

He was also the partner of Emma Goldman, another leading figure of the anarchist movement.\n\nIn 1892, Berkamn, Goldman, and his cousin Modest Aronstam conspired to assassinate Henry Clay Frick, an anti-union factory manager and antagonist of the Homestead Strike. Berkman's plan was to assassinate Frick and then kill himself; Goldman was to explain Berkman's motives after his death; Aronstam was to follow Berkman in the event that he failed in his mission.\n\nThe mission failed and Berkman was arrested. On September 19th, 1892, across the span of just four hours, Berkman was tried, convicted, and sentenced to 21 years in prison, of which he served 14. His experiences in prison were the basis of his first book, \"Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist\", a staple of anarchist literature today.",

In protest of the expulsion, former representative Phillip Joiner led a 25 mile march to Camilla, the county seat, on this day in 1868.\n\nThere, they were attacked by an armed white mob - approximately a dozen marchers were killed and 30-40 wounded. The Camilla Massacre began the era of de facto voting discrimination and political disenfranchisement of the black population in Georgia.\n\nAlthough the expelled legislators eventually won a case in the Georgia Supreme Court (White v. Clements) that gave them the right to hold office, voter intimidation and de facto voting discrimination heightened to such a degree that Georgia went almost sixty years without having a single black legislator in its state congress, although they were legally allowed to do so.",

        "description": "On this day in 1973, following the fascist coup against Chilean President Salvador Allende, American journalist and documentary filmmaker Charles Horman was executed in the National Stadium concentration camp in Santiago.\n\nHorman was born in New York City on May 15th, 1942, graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1960 and Harvard in 1964. He was an active anti-war protester, present at the 1968 DNC protests and producing an award winning documentary titled \"Napalm\". He also worked as an investigative journalist for publications such as The Nation and The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nIn December 1971, Charles and his wife Joyce left the U.S. for Latin America, eventually settling down in Santiago, Chile, where he worked as a freelance writer.\n\nOn September 11th, 1973, fascists led by Augusto Pinochet and the CIA ousted democratically elected Marxist President Salvador Allende. In the following weeks, many prominent left-wing activists, such as Flora Sanhueza, Victor Jara, and Frank Teruggi, were arrested and killed.\n\nHorman himself was arrested on September 16th, seized from his home by Chilean soldiers and taken to the National Stadium, which had been turned into a de facto concentration camp following the coup. There, Horman was executed on September 19th, 1973.\n\nDocuments declassified by the Clinton administration in 1999 indicate the U.S. knew of Horman's plight but initially obfuscated investigations into his death. They also indicated that it was unlikely Horman would have been killed without the knowledge and permission of the CIA.\n\nIn June 2014, a Chilean court ruled that U.S. authorities had played a \"fundamental\" role in Horman's murder. In January 2015, two former Chilean intelligence officials were sentenced to jail in Chile for the murders of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi, another American activist who was also arrested, executed the following day.",

On the morning of August 17th, at the Knip plantation of slave master Caspar Lodewijk van Utrecht at Bandabou, Cura\u00e7ao, the revolt began when Tula and the others slaves gathered and informed van Utrecht they would no longer be his slaves.\n\nThe rebels then left for Lagun, where they freed 22 slaves from jail and went from farm to farm, liberating people as they went. After being defeated in open battle, rebels began a guerrilla campaign, poisoning wells and stealing food.\n\nOn September 19th, 1795, Tula and Karpata were betrayed by a fellow slave. They were taken prisoner, and the war was effectively over. After Tula was captured, he was publicly tortured to death on October 3rd that year.\n\nThe enslaved population was granted more freedom on the island as a result of the uprising, although the system of slavery was not formally abolished until 1863. \n\nToday, August 17th is celebrated in Cura\u00e7ao to commemorate the beginning of the liberation struggle.

Vernon is also known for organizing campaigns of daily picketing outside Woodrow Wilson's White House; participants were known as the \"Silent Sentinels\".\n\nVernon's suffragist organizing began in 1912, when she worked at the National American Woman Suffrage Association convention as an usher. Active in pro-suffrage campaigns in the following years, she took on a role as a leader, along with Alice Paul, in organizing the Silent Sentinels campaign in 1917.\n\nThe Silent Sentinels, also known as the \"Sentinels of Liberty\", were a group of women who protested in front of the White House constantly for two and a half years, holding signs that said \"Mr. President, how long must women wait for liberty?\" and \"Kaiser Wilson, have you forgotten your sympathy with the poor Germans because they were not self-governed? 20,000,000 American women are not self-governed. Take the beam out of your own eye.\"\n\nThroughout the years of protest, many of the approximately 2,000 women who picketed were harassed, arrested, and unjustly treated by local and federal authorities, including the torture and abuse inflicted during the November 14th, 1917 \"Night of Terror\". In total, nearly 500 women were arrested, and 168, including Mabel Vernon, served jail time.\n\nFollowing the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, enfranchising 26 million women, Vernon supported women political candidates and feminist legislation. She also earned a Master's Degree in Political Science from Columbia University in 1924.\n\n\"If our pickets had not done anything more than stand there that first day, they would have accomplished much for the Federal Amendment, because through the press millions and millions of people were reached on that one day and made to think of national woman suffrage.\"\n\n- Mabel Vernon",

Women's suffrage was granted after about two decades of campaigning throughout New Zealand, led by women such as Kate Sheppard (shown) and Mary Ann M\u00fcller.\n\nThe activists delivered a series of petitions to Parliament - over 9,000 signatures were delivered in 1891, followed by a petition of almost 20,000 signatures in 1892, and finally in 1893 nearly 32,000 signatures were presented, almost a quarter of the adult European female population of New Zealand. Through this popular pressure, a bill was passed that granted women the right to vote.\n\nSome historians have noted that colonialism was regressive for women's rights in New Zealand. Writing for The Guardian, Emma Espiner stated:\n\n\"The settler scholars who transmuted our oral language into a written one reframed our myths and legends so that our female deities were subservient to the male. These same 'historians' assumed that our chiefs were all men and wrote them into the histories as such.\n\nOur pronouns and many of our names were gender-neutral long before the concept became a source of anxiety for conservative columnists, so it was straightforward for ethnographers to assign a male gender to the chiefs named in our oral tradition. M\u0101ori women leaders simply disappeared.\"",

        "description": "Paulo Freire, born on this day in 1921, was a Brazilian philosopher and radical pedagogue most known for his 1968 work Pedagogy of the Oppressed. \"Language is never neutral.\"\n\nPaulo was born in Recife, the capital of the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco. Initially affluent, his family experienced hardship during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and Freire's education suffered due to his own experiences with poverty and hunger.\n\nFreire began working as a schoolteacher in the 1940s, beginning to serve as the director of the Pernambuco Department of Education and Culture in 1946. Due to the 1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat, where a military dictatorship was put in place with the support of the United States, Paulo Freire was exiled from his home country, an exile that lasted 16 years.\n\nFreire then worked in Chile, until April 1969 when he accepted a temporary position at Harvard University. It was during this period, in 1968, that Freire published his most famous work, \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\".\n\nIn this text, Freire criticizes what he calls the \"banking method\" of education, wherein a teacher \"deposits\" knowledge into an empty vessel, the student, or \"bank\". Instead, Freire calls upon teacher to engage in a more dialog-centric or creative education, one in which the suppressed experiences of the oppressed help create knowledge, fostering a social reality in which the marginalized are humanized.\n\nPedagogy of the Oppressed has since become the third most cited book in the social sciences, according to Elliott D. Green. As of 2000, the book had sold over 750,000 copies worldwide.\n\n\"Manipulation, sloganizing, depositing, regimentation, and prescription cannot be components of revolutionary praxis, precisely because they are the components of the praxis of domination.\"\n\n- Paulo Freire",

Ultimately, the rally's show of support was ineffectual; PATCO was de-certified as a union and the striking ATC workers did not get their jobs back.\n\nA 2nd Solidarity March was held near the 10 year anniversary of the original Solidary Day March. Union members, in the wake of the Gulf War, called on the federal government to turn its attention away from foreign affairs and to focus on domestic issues like improving health care and education and supporting workers' rights. Approximately 250,000-500,000 people took part in either event.",

The film alleges that Horman's discovery of U.S. complicity in the coup led to his secret arrest, disappearance, and execution.\n\nState documents declassified during the Clinton Administration mention Teruggi as one of the Chilean military executions and showed that, initially U.S. embassy officials in Santiago released false information that he had returned to the United States.\n\nIn 2011, Chilean judge Jorge Zepeda indicted Ray E. Davis, commander of the U.S. Military Group in Chile during the time of the coup, along with Pedro Espinoza, a Chilean general, and Rafael Gonz\u00e1lez Verdugo, a member of Chilean army intelligence, in the murders of Frank Teruggi and Charles Horman.

Dessalines was assassinated by rebels in 1806, leading directly to civil war.\n\nDessalines was born to an enslaved Congolese family in 1758. He adopted the name Dessalines after escaping from a free black landowner who had purchased him.\n\nIn 1794, Dessalines's military skill and leadership were vital to L'Overture's success in capturing the Spanish-controlled eastern half of the island, and in return, L'Overture made him governor of the south.\n\nAfter L'Overture's betrayal and death in 1802-03, Dessalines became a key leader of the Haitian Revolution, helping the colony achieve the new nation's independence in 1804.\n\nIn 1804, Dessalines appointed himself emperor for life and ordered mass killings of all the French colonizers remaining on the island, leading to the deaths of 3000-5000 French people of all ages and sexes. He declared \"I have saved my country. I have avenged America.\"\n\nThe 1805 Constitution established by Dessalines' government made Haiti the first country in history to abolish slavery. The Constitution also guaranteed equality under the law, freedom of religion, and protected property rights, with an exception - \"No whiteman of whatever nation he may be, shall put his foot on this territory with the title of master or proprietor, neither shall he in future acquire any property therein\".\n\nIn 1806, Dessalines was assassinated by rebels outside Port-au-Prince, leading directly to civil war on the island.",

His descriptions of the unsanitary and inhumane conditions that workers suffered shocked and galvanized its readers to such a degree that domestic and foreign purchases of American meat to fall by half and federal regulations of the meat industry increased.\n\nSinclair also discriminated against people of color and Jewish people. With income from \"The Jungle\", he founded a utopian community called \"Helicon Home Colony\" in Englewood, New Jersey, explicitly excluding both black and Jewish people. The colony burned down under suspicious circumstances within a year.\n\nIn the 1920s, Sinclair moved to Monrovia, California (near Los Angeles), where he founded the state's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). In 1934, Sinclair ran in the California gubernatorial election as a Democrat.\n\nSinclair's platform, known as the End Poverty in California movement (EPIC), galvanized the support of the Democratic Party. Sinclair gained its nomination, but was defeated by the incumbent Frank Merriam.\n\n\"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\"\n\n- Upton Sinclair",

        "description": "Kwame Nkrumah, born on this day in 1909, was a Ghanaian politician and pan-African socialist revolutionary. \"I am not African because I was born in Africa but because Africa was born in me.\"\n\nNkrumah served as the first Prime Minister and President of Ghana, having led the Gold Coast to independence from Britain in 1957.\n\nAn influential advocate of pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organization of African Unity and winner of the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union in 1962.\n\nIn 1960, Ghanaians approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah President. His administration funded national industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national education system and promoted a pan-Africanist culture. Under Nkrumah, Ghana played a leading role in African international relations during the decolonization period.\n\nIn 1964, a constitutional amendment made Ghana a one-party state, with Nkrumah as president for life of both the nation and its party. Nkrumah was deposed in 1966 by the National Liberation Council, which, under the supervision of international financial institutions, privatized many of the country's state corporations.\n\nJohn Stockwell, a former CIA agent, wrote that the CIA was intimately involved in the coup that ousted him from power. Nkrumah lived the rest of his life in Guinea, of which he was named honorary co-president.\n\n\"I am not African because I was born in Africa but because Africa was born in me.\"\n\n- Kwame Nkrumah",

He had been detained after anarchists bombed Bolshevik headquarters in 1919.\n\nChernyi advocated a Nietzschean overthrow of the values of bourgeois Russian society and rejected the voluntary communes of anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin as a threat to the freedom of the individual.\n\nAfter he published anarchist literature, Chernyi was imprisoned in Siberia under the Russian Czarist regime for revolutionary activities. In 1917, Chernyi was released from prison by the Imperial Russian regime and became a leading anarchist figure in Russia.\n\nChernyi strongly denounced the Bolshevik government and joined the underground anarchist resistance movements against it. On September 25th, 1919, the \"Underground Anarchists\" bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party during a plenary meeting, causing 67 casualties.\n\nFollowing this bombing, a wave of repression against the anarchist movement took place. Chernyi was among those detained, charged with counterfeiting, although, according to anarchist historian Paul Avrich, there is no evidence he personally played a role in the bombing.\n\nOn September 21st, 1921, the Cheka executed Lev Chernyi without trial.",

These agents had been working in collaboration with members of the Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations, a U.S.-sponsored anti-Castro militant group.\n\nAccording to John Dinges, author of \"The Condor Years\", documents released in 2015 revealed a 1978 CIA report that proved they had knowledge Pinochet ordered the murders. A State Department document also refers to eight separate CIA reports from around the same date. Pinochet, who died in 2006, was never charged for these crimes.",

The Committee issued several widely circulated \"Proclamas\", statements attacking the exploitation of the Puerto Ricans by the Spanish and calling for an anti-colonial insurrection.\n\nOn September 23rd, 1868, the Grito de Lares began when several hundred rebels arrived at the town of Lares, looting stores, seizing City Hall, imprisoning Spanish-born merchants, and flying the revolutionary flag of Lares at the town's church. The Republic of Puerto Rico was proclaimed and revolutionaries offered freedom to any enslaved people who joined them.\n\nThe insurrection ended the next day when the Puerto Rican militia, significantly better armed than the rebels, put down the rebellion by force. Although all revolutionaries were initially sentenced to death by a military court, political pressure led the Spanish President to declare a general amnesty and free all prisoners, although the leaders of the uprising were still exiled.",

His 1978 assassination contributed to a popular uprising which successfully ousted Anastasio Somoza in 1979.\n\nPedro Joaqu\u00edn Chamorro Cardenal served as editor of \"La Prensa\", the only significant opposition newspaper to the rule of the Somoza family, which had ruled the country since 1937. Chamorro also an activist who founded the Democratic Union of Liberation (UDEL).\n\nAccording to his widow, Violeta, Chamorro remained a staunch critic of the government despite being arrested, tortured, and being made aware of plans of his own assassination. In 1975, Chamorro wrote to Somoza, stating \"I am waiting, with a clear conscience, and a soul at peace, for the blow you are to deliver.\"\n\nOn January 10th, 1978, at 53 years old, Chamorro was shot 18 times by three men in a car who forced his auto to the curb. In the aftermath of his death, tens of thousands of Nicaraguans took to the streets in anti-government protests. A general strike broke out in the capital Managua, paralyzing the city.\n\nThe following year, the decades long rule of the Somoza regime finally came to an end when Anastasio Somoza was ousted, fleeing to Miami. The anti-capitalist Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) came into power, making significant gains in literacy, health care, education, childcare, unions, and land reform.\n\nIn 1990, Pedro's widow Violeta Charmorro became the first and only female President of Nicaragua, serving until 1997.",

In the piece, Professor Rossi argued that for most women motherhood had become a full-time occupation, a state of affairs that hurt not only women but also the larger society in which they lived. For the well-being of both the women and the culture, she argued, parity of the sexes is essential.\n\nThe year \"Equality Between the Sexes\" was published coincided with the publication of \"The Feminine Mystique\" by Betty Friedan, a fellow feminist author and activist. Professor Rossi's argument was considered subversive at the time, and in later interviews she recalled being called a monster, an unnatural woman, and an unfit mother.\n\nIn 1966, Rossi, along with Betty Friedan and others, founded the National Organization for Women (NOW).\n\n\"Demands for equality for women are threats to men's self-esteem and sense of sexual turf.\"\n\n- Alice S.

The government, however, replied with repressions against all Anarchists. Many members of the underground group were executed, a number of Moscow Anarchists were arrested, and in the provinces every expression of the Anarchist movement was suppressed.\"",

All of them participated in the insurrection.\n\nAt the time of the uprising, Gabriel Prosser was twenty-four years old, six feet two inches, literate, and a blacksmith by trade. He was described by a contemporary as \"a fellow of courage and intellect above his rank in life.\"\n\nWith the help of other enslaved people, Prosser devised a plan to seize control of Richmond by killing off the white population (excepting the Methodists, Quakers, and Frenchmen) and establishing a Kingdom of Virginia with himself as monarch.\n\nProsser was betrayed twice - first by others enslaved by Thomas Prosser who told him about the plan, and then by slaves in Norfolk, who turned a fleeing Prosser in to the authorities for a bounty.\n\nOn September 25th, 1800, Prosser was captured. He was executed along with two of his brothers and 23 other enslaved people a few weeks later, on October 6th.",

Hurst (1908 - 1990) in broad daylight while delivering cotton near Liberty. Hurst was acquitted after claiming self-defense.\n\nHerbert Lee was an American civil rights activist remembered as a proponent of voting rights for African Americans in Mississippi, who had been disenfranchised since 1890.\n\nLee was a charter member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Amite County and sought to enfranchise black Americans by encouraging voter registration.\n\nIn 1961, Lee assisted Bob Moses, a field secretary with Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), in his efforts to persuade locals to register. His activities were met with threats of reprisal by the white community, and Lee became one of the movement's earliest victims to white violence.\n\nOn September 25th, 1961, Lee was murdered by Mississippi state representative E. H. Hurst (1908 - 1990) in broad daylight at the cotton gin while delivering cotton near Liberty.\n\nHurst killed Lee with a single shot to the head, but later claimed in court that he was defending himself after Lee attacked him with a tire iron. An all-white jury ruled that the killing was a justifiable homicide. In 1964, civil rights activist Louis Allen was killed after he informed federal investigators that his testimony in the case was forced on threat of violence.",

He was also openly critical of Mahatma Gandhi, having become disillusioned with his non-violent tactics after Gandhi called off the non-cooperation movement.\n\nIn December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in retaliation for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, a popular Indian nationalist leader who died after being attacked by police. On the run from the police, Singh was arrested when he, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, exploded two improvised bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi, showered leaflets onto the legislators below, and allowed the authorities to arrest them.\n\nAwaiting trial, Singh gained public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners. Das died from starvation in September 1929. Singh was convicted and hanged in March, 1931. Four days before his execution, Singh refused to sign a letter drafted for him that would appeal for clemency.\n\n\"Non-violence is backed by the theory of soul-force in which suffering is courted in the hope of ultimately winning over the opponent. But what happens when such an attempt fail to achieve the object? It is here that soul-force has to be combined with physical force so as not to remain at the mercy of tyrannical and ruthless enemy.\"\n\n- Bhagat Singh",

The group's slogan was \"Sifuna Zonke!\" (\"We want everything!\").\n\nThe IWA was one of the first trade unions for African workers ever formed in South Africa. After calling a general strike, the South African government arrested and charged seven activists - three from the International Socialists League, three from the Industrial Workers of Africa, and two from the Transvaal Native Congress - for \"incitement to public violence.\"\n\nThis trial would be the first time white and black activists are jointly charged for political activities in South Africa.\n\nAn excerpt from the IWA manifesto reads:\n\n\"There is only one way of deliverance for you Bantu workers. Unite as workers. Unite: forget the things which divide you. Let there be no longer any talk of Basuto, Zulu, or Shangaan. You are all labourers; let Labour be your common bond.\"",

        "description": "David Walker (1796 - 1830) was an American abolitionist and author who published \"An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World\" on this day in 1829. The piece was an early historical call for black unity in the fight against slavery.\n\nThe text was widely read at the time and has become regarded as one of the most important political documents of the 19th century, influencing multiple generations of black leaders that came after it, including Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King, and Malcolm X. Not surprisingly, the text infuriated southern slaveowners; the state of Georgia offered a $10,000 bounty for Walker alive and $1,000 for him dead.\n\nWalker died the next year, soon after publishing the third edition of his Appeal. Although foul play was suspected, historians consider it more likely he died of tuberculosis, which his daughter had passed away from a week prior. David Walker's son, Edward G. Walker, was an attorney and, in 1866, was one of the first two black men elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature.\n\n\"Now, I ask you, had you not rather be killed than to be a slave to a tyrant, who takes the life of your mother, wife, and dear little children? Look upon your mother, wife and children, and answer God Almighty; and believe this, that it is no more harm for you to kill a man who is trying to kill you, than it is for you to take a drink of water when thirsty.\"\n\n- David Walker",

Millions participated, attacking Japanese and US collaborators and burning rice collection records as the state imposed martial law.\n\nAccording to political sociologist Gi-Wook Shin, the uprising began on October 1st, 1946 when 300 railroad workers initiated a strike in the South Korean city of Taegu (also spelled Daegu). The following morning, thousands of workers carried the body of a striker murdered by police throughout the city and then raided the local police station, capturing 50 policemen.\n\nBy October 6th, 38 Taegu policemen had been killed, martial law was declared, and American tanks were patrolling the city. The uprising that began in Taegu had also expanded into rural areas, transforming the urban strike into a major national uprising.\n\nParticipants of the 1946 uprisings targeted rice collection agencies, landlords, and policemen and city officials who had collaborated with the Japanese and American occupiers. Rebels wrecked the homes of police officers and burned records of grain and rice collections.\n\nGi-Wook Shin notes that, by the end of 1946, approximately 30% of South Korean counties had bore witness to these peasant uprisings. While no accurate count of participants or casualties exists, Shin provides estimates of 2.3 million people participating in the uprising, 30,000 protesters arrested, and 1,000 protesters and 200 police officers killed in total.\n\nProfessor of Korea-Pacific Studies Stephan Haggard has noted the defeat of the uprising as a turning point for the power struggle in Korea, as the PRK people's committees and the National Council of Korean Labor Unions were weakened by the suppression.",

At least 500,000 were killed.\n\nThe assassinations were blamed on the Communist Party on Indonesia (KPI) by the army and various civic and religious groups, and the resulting campaign of mass murder and arrests, backed by several Western powers, led to the ousting of Indonesian nationalist President Sukarno, the deaths of anywhere from 500,000 to 3 million people, and the installation of Suharto, a brazenly corrupt anti-communist, as President.\n\nBlaming the KPI for the assassination of the generals, Suharto's forces began purging insitutions of alleged Sukarno and PKI loyalists, arresting and summarily executing many important PKI figures. As leftists, real or alleged, were violently removed from civil and military institutions, reactionaries began directing violence towards ordinary civilians.\n\nThe campaign of repression was both widespread and brutal; victims were tortured, impaled, beheaded, and rivers were left congested with masses of corpses. The most conservative estimates suggest 500,000 people were killed in total, while higher estimates range from 2-3 million.\n\nWestern powers, including the U.S., Britain, Australia, and Sweden, both supported and directly aided the anti-communist pogroms. In 1962, three years before the killings began, both the U.S. and British governments that it would be necessary \"to liquidate Sukarno\".\n\nThe U.S. trained more than 1,200 anti-communist military officers, providing them weapons and economic assistance. During the massacres, the U.S. supported the Indonesian military's actions, even providing the government with lists of suspected communists to target.\n\nBritish Foreign Office documents declassified in 2021 revealed that British propagandists secretly incited anti-communists, including army generals, to eliminate the PKI, and used \"black propaganda\", propaganda intended to create the impression that it was created by those it is supposed to discredit, due to Sukarno's hostility to the formation of former British colonies into the Malayan federation from 1963.\n\nWestern media and politicians repeated false propaganda from Suharto's Indonesian government downplaying the violence while also celebrating the violent repression taking place. Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt wrote in the NY Times \"With 500,000 to 1 million Communist sympathizers knocked off, I think it is safe to assume a reorientation has taken place\" The NY Times also published a racist article saying the murders were to be expected in \"violent Asia, where life is cheap\".\n\nAmerican oil tycoon H.

Hunt called Sukarno's ousting the \"greatest victory for freedom since the last decisive battle of World War II.\" Time magazine described the suppression of the KPI \"The West's best news for years in Asia\" and praised Suharto as \"scrupulously constitutional.\"\n\nThe politicide ended in 1966. Sukarno died under house arrest in 1970. Suharto would rule as head of the Western-backed military \"New Order\" regime for over 30 years, while amassing a personal fortune. The massacres continue to be downplayed in the official Indonesian historiography.\n\nIn his 2020 book \"The Jakarta Method\", journalist Vincent Bevins argues that the massacre provided the blueprint for American campaigns of suppression of leftist movements around the world. To this day, no Western government has apologized for their involvement in the Indonesian politicide.",

Jerry and prominent members of the rescue fled to Canada afterward.\n\nEarlier that year, the pro-slavery Secretary of State Daniel Webster had warned that the new Fugitive Slave Act (passed in 1850) would be enforced even \"here in Syracuse in the midst of the next Anti-Slavery Convention.\" The arrest was considered a message that the locally-unpopular law would be enforced by federal authorities.\n\nThe abolitionist Liberty Party was holding a state convention in Syracuse and, when Jerry's arrest became known, several hundred abolitionists broke into the city jail and freed him. The event came to be widely known as the \"Jerry Rescue\".\n\nJerry himself was hidden in Syracuse for several days, then was taken to the Orson Ames House in Mexico, New York, and from there to Oswego, before crossing Lake Ontario into freedom in Canada. Many of the prominent members of the jailbreak also fled to Canada, including Reverend J.W. Loguen and Minister Samuel Ringgold Ward.",

A Choctaw leader called the forced deportations \"a trail of tears and death\".\n\nThe Trail of Tears was the cumulative result of a series of forced relocations of approximately 60,000-100,000 Native Americans in the United States from their ancestral homelands in the southeast to areas west of the Mississippi River that had been designated as \"Indian Territory\".\n\nIn 1837-38, President Martin Van Buren allowed Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama, using an armed force of 7,000 people, to relocate about 13,000 Cherokees to Cleveland, Tennessee. On October 1st, 1838, the first major group of Cherokee, more than 12,000 people in hundreds of covered wagons, were forced out of Tennessee, traveling westward from the town of Red Clay.\n\nTaking the journey through an unusually cold winter, they suffered terribly from exposure, disease, and starvation, killing several thousand people while en route to their new designated reserve. They were also attacked by locals and economically exploited - starving Indians were charged a dollar a head, equal to $24.01 today, to cross the Ohio River, which typically charged twelve cents, equal to $2.88 today.",

        "description": "The Parsley Massacre was a genocidal act of violence committed against Haitians living in the northwestern Dominican Republic, initiated on this day in 1937 by Rafael Trujillo. Tens of thousands were murdered at the hands of Dominican troops.\n\nEstimates of the amount of Haitians killed in the massacre, known as \"kout kouto-a \" in Creole (\"the stabbing\") and \"El Corte\" in Spanish (\"the cutting\"), range from 12,000-35,000.\n\nThe violence was carried out by the Dominican Army on the orders of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, who initiated it with this statement, given on October 2nd, 1937:\n\n\"To the Dominicans who were complaining of the depredations by Haitians living among them, thefts of cattle, provisions, fruits, etc., and were thus prevented from enjoying in peace the products of their labor, I have responded, 'I will fix this.' And we have already begun to remedy the situation. Three hundred Haitians are now dead in B\u00e1nica. This remedy will continue.\"\n\nIn the following week, hundreds of Dominican troops poured into the region, killing Haitians with rifles, machetes, shovels, knives, and bayonets. Haitian children were thrown in the air and caught by soldiers' bayonets, then thrown on their mothers' corpses. Others were drowned in the sea, making identification and counting of the dead impossible.\n\nThe term \"Parsley Massacre\" for the genocide came from the method that Dominican soldiers would use to determine whether or not those living on the border were native Dominicans or immigrant Haitians - they would hold up a sprig of parsley to someone and ask them what it was.\n\nIf the person could pronounce it the Spanish way (\"perejil\"), the soldiers considered them Dominican and let them live, however if they pronounced it with a French or Creole accent, they were considered Haitian and executed.\n\n\"Before the massacre, in the frontier, there were always two sides, the people were one, united.\"\n\n- an anonymous survivor of the Parsley Massacre",

More than 1,300 people were arrested.\n\nThe crowd, which also included non-students such as residential neighbors, bystanders, and children, had gathered to protest the government's actions and listen peacefully to speeches.\n\nAlthough the Mexican government stated gunfire from the surrounding apartments prompted the army's attack, multiple eyewitness accounts claim they saw a military flare go up as a sign to begin firing on the crowd. The government also had hidden soldiers with machine guns in the apartment buildings they claimed they were fired upon from.\n\nEstimates of the total killed range from 300-400, and over 1,300 people were arrested. The event radicalized Subcomandante Marcos, who later became a prominent member of the Zapatistas, an indigenous group that fights for liberation from the Mexican government.\n\nThe massacre also led CIA agent Philip Agee, an eyewitness to the violence, to resign from the organization in protest and author \"Inside the Company: CIA Diary\", which detailed his work on behalf of American imperialism and caused him to be deported from the United Kingdom.",

These demands included the abolition of \"task work\", an increase in relief payments, all work schemes to be paid at trade union rates, and adequate outdoor allowances for all single unemployed men and women who were not receiving unemployment benefits.\n\nOn October 3rd, 1932, a crowd of 30,000 protesters marched from Frederick Street Labour Exchange, holding a mass meeting on the Custom House steps. Notably, Catholics and Protestants set aside their differences to unite in class struggle.\n\nAfter negotiations with the relief workers fell through, they called a rent strike, lit bonfires in working class districts, and speakers from the strike committee addressed thousands. Thousands of police were called in. Over the next several days, protesters clashed in battles with police and many workers were killed and injured.\n\nWorkers won most of their demands, including big cash increases in their relief pay. One of the main demands, though, was not conceded - the giving of relief to single persons.

A Marxist-Leninist and Pan-Africanist, he was viewed by supporters as a charismatic and iconic figure of revolution, sometimes referred to as \"Africa's Che Guevara\".\n\nOn October 4th, 1984, Sankara spoke at the United Stations, expressing international solidarity with oppressed peoples all over the world. Here is a short excerpt from the speech:\n\n\"Let me say to those who are listening to me now that I speak not only on behalf of Burkina Faso, my country which I love so much, but also on behalf of all those who suffer, wherever they may be.\n\nI speak on behalf of those millions of human beings who are in ghettos because their skin is black, or because they have a different kind of culture, those whose status is hardly higher than that of an animal.\n\nI suffer, too, on behalf of those Indians who have been massacred, trampled on and humiliated and who, for centuries, have been confined to reservations, so that they do not have any aspirations to any rights whatsoever, so that their culture cannot become enriched through contact with other cultures, including that of the invader.\n\nI speak out on behalf of those who are unemployed because of a structurally unjust system which has now been completely disrupted, the unemployed who have been reduced to seeing their lives as only the reflection of the lives of those who have more than themselves.\n\nI speak on behalf of women throughout the entire world who suffer from a system of exploitation imposed on them by men\".",

Both were both excommunicated by the Catholic church, and eleven years of their twenty-nine year marriage were separated by one or both serving time in prison.\n\nBerrigan frequently engaged in civil disobedience to protest the Vietnam War. On May 17th, while out on bail from a similar act six months prior, Berrigan and eight other radical Christians walked into the offices of the local draft board in Catonsville, Maryland, removed 600 draft records, doused them in napalm, and burnt them in a lot outside of the building.\n\nThe group issued a statement, saying \"We confront the Roman Catholic Church, other Christian bodies, and the synagogues of America with their silence and cowardice in the face of our country's crimes. We are convinced that the religious bureaucracy in this country is racist, is an accomplice in this war, and is hostile to the poor.\" All nine were sentenced to three years in prison.\n\n\"The poor tell us who we are, the prophets tell us who we could be, so we hide the poor and kill the prophets.\"\n\n- Philip Berrigan",

During the strike, a worker was shot and killed, and he and another IWW leader present, Arturo Giovannitti, were arrested on scarce evidence.\n\nBoth were eventually acquitted of charges of having been an accessory to the murder. Ettor was one of the leaders of the Waiters Strike of 1912 in New York City, and the Brooklyn Barbers Strike of 1913.\n\n\"If the workers of the world want to win, all they have to do is recognize their own solidarity.

Known as a \"Mississippi appendectomy\", this was a frequent occurrence under Mississippi's compulsory, white supremacist sterilization plan to reduce the number of poor black people in the state.\n\nHamer was threatened, harassed, shot at, and assaulted by white supremacists and police while trying to register for and exercise her right to vote.\n\nDuring a voter registration drive Hamer participated in, police fined the group because their bus was \"too yellow\". When she returned home, her family's landlord told her that, if didn\u2019t withdraw her voter registration, she would be fired from her job and forced to leave.\n\nOn her way back from a SNCC organizing meeting, Hamer was arrested and beaten in custody. She sustained lifelong injuries from the assault, including a blood clot in her eye that left her partially blind.\n\nHamer later helped and encouraged thousands of African-Americans in Mississippi to become registered voters, and helped hundreds of disenfranchised people in her area through her work in programs like the Freedom Farm Cooperative, formed to subvert state oppression of poor black workers in the agricultural industry.\n\n\"Nobody's free until everybody's free.\"\n\n- Fannie Lou Hamer",

In response to this, a general strike was declared on March 25th.\n\nSoto and his comrades traveled along farms of the cordillera of the Andes recruiting rural workers of several large farms, driving the southeast of Santa Cruz into an uprising. They requisitioned arms and food for the campaign, granting vouchers promising to eventually return the goods and occasionally taking the landowners and managers hostage.\n\nIn the aftermath of the strike, Soto fled the country and settled in Puntas Aras, Chile.

They faced fierce opposition from law enforcement - over just ten days, four people were killed and eighty-six were wounded.\n\nThe Bayonne Refinery Strikes of 1915-1916 were labor actions of refinery workers in Bayonne, New Jersey, mostly Polish-Americans, who struck against Rockefeller-owned Standard Oil and Tidewater Petroleum plants.\n\nOn October 8th, 1916, thousands of Standard Oil workers went on strike, demanding higher wages. The strikers faced fierce opposition from law enforcement, and the labor action became violent. In the course of the ten-day strike, 4 people were killed and 86 were wounded.\n\nAccording to communist journalist John Reed (an eyewitness to the strike action), this was the first time in an industrial dispute where police announced that their explicit objective was to break the strike.\n\nMultiple journalists in Bayonne criticized mainstream press as portraying the strikers and protesters as more violent than they actually were; according to Reed and others, the violence was initiated by police themselves.",

        "description": "On this day in 1967, communist revolutionary Che Guevara was executed by CIA-assisted forces in Bolivia, where he had been attempting to foment revolution. His last words were \"Shoot, you are only going to kill a man.\"\n\nErnesto \"Che\" Guevara was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and military theorist. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.\n\nAfter serving in Castro's government, Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment revolution abroad, first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia. While agitating for communist revolution in Bolivia, Guevara was captured by CIA-assisted state forces and summarily executed on this day in 1967.\n\nOn November 3rd, 1966, Guevara had secretly arrived in La Paz on a flight from Montevideo under the false name Adolfo Mena Gonz\u00e1lez, posing as a middle-aged Uruguayan businessman working for the Organization of American States (OAS). Once there, Guevara had difficulty getting cooperation from both local dissidents and the Bolivian Communist Party, despite besting the Bolivian military in several skirmishes.\n\nTo help crush the resistance movement, the Bolivian government and U.S. military relied on the expertise of fugitive Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, who had undermined the French Resistance and was responsible for the torture and murder of its leader, Jean Moulin.\n\nSome of the inhabitants willingly informed the Bolivian authorities and military about the guerrillas and their movements in the area, which contributed to Guevara's capture on October 7th, 1967. He famously shouted \"Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and I am worth more to you alive than dead!\", however he remained defiant in captivity.\n\nOn October 9th, on orders from the Bolivian President Ren\u00e9 Barrientos, Guevara was executed. In the documentary \"My Enemy's Enemy\", German journalist Kai Hermann alleged that Barbie devised the strategy that led to Guevara's capture.\n\n\"The true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality.\"\n\n- Che Guevara",

His controversial trial and execution in 1938 alienated communist sympathizers in the West.\n\nAs a young man, Bukharin joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906, becoming a member of the Bolshevik faction. He served on a committee that was infiltrated by the Tsarist secret police, the Okhrana, and was imprisoned and exiled in 1911.\n\nIn 1911, Bukharin escaped exile, fleeing to Germany. During this period, he met Vladimir Lenin for the first time and authored \"Imperialism and World Economy\", a work that predated and influenced Lenin's \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\".\n\nAfter Lenin's death in 1924, Bukharin became a full member of the Politburo, allying himself with Stalin in the power struggles of that period. Bukharin formulated the thesis of \"Socialism in One Country\" put forth by Stalin in 1924, which argued that socialism could be developed in a single country, even one as underdeveloped as Russia.\n\nBukharin was aligned with the forces that defeated Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, and Grigory Zinoviev in various power struggles within the Communist Party. A supporter of the market-based New Economic Policy (NEP), Bukharin opposed Stalin's support of collectivization policies in the late 1920s. On this basis, he was criticized and began politically conspiring against Stalin.\n\nAfter the trial and execution of Zinoviev, Kamenev, and other \"Old Bolsheviks\" in 1936, Bukharin was arrested in 1937 and charged with conspiring to overthrow the Soviet state. The following trial was controversial and drew international criticism, alienating some communist sympathizers abroad.\n\nFrench author Romain Rolland wrote to Stalin directly, arguing that \"an intellect like that of Bukharin is a treasure for his country\" and drawing comparisons to the execution of chemist Antoine Lavoisier, guillotined during the French Revolution: \"We in France, the most ardent revolutionaries...still profoundly grieve and regret what we did...I beg you to show clemency.\" Bukharin was executed by gunshot on March 15th, 1938, at the Kommunarka shooting ground.\n\n\"We see now that infringement of freedom is necessary with regard to the opponents of the revolution. At a time of revolution we cannot allow freedom for the enemies of the people and of the revolution. That is a surely clear, irrefutable conclusion.\"\n\n- Nikolai Bukharin",

At least two witnesses who testified against Saro-Wiwa later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony in the presence of Shell's lawyer.\n\nOn November 10th, 1995, the Ogoni nine were hanged by the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha.

Riots began after police killed four demonstrators, prompting a U.S. occupation that lasted until October 23rd.\n\nIn the months preceding the uprising, the \"Liga de Inquilinos y Subsistencia\" (English: Tenants' Subsistence League) had been organizing against rent increases and poor living conditions. On the last day of September, in response to the government of Panama repressing this organizing, the League announced a rent strike to begin October 1st. \n\nOn Saturday, October 10th, 1925, the League organized a massive rally in Panama City to protest increased rents and poor living conditions. This was held in defiance of a state ban on such a gathering.\n\nPanama City Mayor Mario Galindo had permitted the National Police to respond to any large gatherings with violent force. Accordingly, at the October 10th rally, four tenants were shot dead by police following a confrontation at Parque de Santa Ana, and many more were injured.\n\nRiots broke out following this violence. By Sunday, October 11th, the city district of Santa Ana had come almost entirely under the control of the Tenants' League. With the police ineffectual in stopping the revolt, the government of President Rodolfo Chiari requested the military intervention of the United States.\n\nWithin a few days (sources differ on the exact day, ranging from October 12th to October 15th), approximately 600 United States soldiers entered Panama City. Stationing themselves at Parque de Santa Ana and Parque de Lesseps, they conducted raids on the offices and apartments of Tenants' League leaders, quickly crushing the uprising by arresting its prime organizers.\n\nWhile the uprising was ongoing, government officials met with tenant and landlord representatives in Panama City. According to the Academy of American Franciscan History, the government promised more public works projects, a shake-up of the national police force, and to establish a rent claims commission that met daily to hear tenant grievances.\n\nThe U.S. troops continued to occupy Panama City until October 24th, by which point the protests had subsided. On October 30th, the League and landlords signed an agreement to end the strike.\n\n\"With rhythmic heels that oppressed the heart and clouded the eyes, an army of soldiers in battle dress, with helmets of the kind used in the European war, entered with a fixed bayonet, sweaty, their backpacks on their shoulders, and their revolvers on their belts.\"\n\n- Revista Loter\u00eda, October-November 1973 issue, describing the American military presence",

Workers demanded housing, rights for temporary workers, wages to follow regional differences in the cost of living, and clearer standards for promotions.\n\nThe government did not respond for three months, assuming the strike would collapse due to economic pressure. Workers had prepared for this, however, taking up community collections, the community exiling strikebreaking workers, and women of the household economically sustaining families while workers were on strike.\n\nOn March 19th, the workers' union accepted a set of proposals favorable to their demands and returned to work. The strike ended with a long, celebratory march into Thi\u00e8s, followed by meetings and dancing.",

        "description": "On this day in 1972, inmates at a Washington, D.C. jail seized control of part of their prison, taking hostages and demanding to be released.\n\nThe uprising began when an inmate pretending to have a seizure drew a loaded .38 pistol on the two officers that came to check on him. After subduing the officers, they freed 50 other inmates and took control of the cellblock, capturing several other guards as hostages in the process.\n\nThe inmates demanded to speak to a prison reporter, Washington Claiborne. Inmates issued varying statements to him that indicated a revolutionary fervor among prisoners:\n\n\"We don't want nothin' but the sidewalk. What do you think we want, better food? Bullshit. We want the sidewalk, man.\"\n\n\"We want you to understand one thing very clearly. This is not a riot, it's a revolution.\"\n\n\"We ain't bitches, man. We don't mind dying for the fucking cause.\"\n\nPrison negotiators eventually got the inmates to back off of demanding release, but only in exchange for the opportunity to go before a federal judge to air their grievances about the jail and the promise of no reprisals for their actions. The inmates got their hearing, and a new facility was built.\n\nDespite the promise of no reprisals, all nine inmates who participated in the uprising were prosecuted and convicted on various charges.",

Although City Council approved the lease, Mayor Wes Uhlman vetoed the action, causing supporters to occupy the mayor's office. A five-year lease signed January 20th, 1973, at $1 rent annually.\n\nAccording to author David Wilma, in 1997 the school district insisted on fair market rates, causing rent for the property to rise to $12,000 a month. By 1999, El Centro owed $150,000 in back rent. Grants from the City of Seattle and from Washington state totaling $1 million finally allowed El Centro to buy the site from the school district.\n\nToday, El Centro de la Raza continues to function as an educational, cultural, and social service agency. It is considered a significant part of civil rights history in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn 2015, El Centro de la Raza built more than one hundred moderately-priced apartments south of its main building. The apartments are designed for families making 30-60% of the average median annual income in Seattle, or $24,000 to $49,000.",

A total of four detectives and seven striking mine workers were killed, with five guards, thirty miners, and an unrecorded number of strikebreakers wounded.\n\nAfter this incident, Illinois Governor John Tanner ordered the National Guard to prevent any more strikebreakers from coming into the state by force. The next month, the Chicago-Virden Coal Company relented and allowed the unionization of its workers.\n\n\"When the last call comes for me to take my \ufb01nal rest, will the miners see that I get a resting place in the same clay that shelters the miners who gave up their lives on the hills of Virden, Illinois...They are responsible for Illinois being the best organized labor state in America.\"\n\n- Mother Jones",

Despite being a member of the Communist Party, she was imprisoned and sentenced to manual labor during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nIn her early career, Ding Ling wrote highly successful short stories centering on young, unconventional Chinese women. Around 1930, she became a major literary figure of the leftist literature.\n\nIn 1931, her husband, communist poet Hu Yepin, was executed in Shanghai by the right-wing Kuomintang government for his association with the Communists. Shortly thereafter, Ding joined the Chinese Communist Party and her work reflected communist values.\n\nAccording to authors Glenn Kucha and Jennifer Llewellyn, in 1957 Ding was denounced as a \"rightist\", purged from the party, imprisoned, and her fiction and essays were banned.\n\nDing and her husband were then sent to the countryside and compelled to do manual labor for more than a decade. She was rehabilitated sometime in the years following Mao Zedong's death in 1976.\n\n\"Happiness is to take up the struggle in the midst of the raging storm and not to pluck the lute in the moonlight or recite poetry among the blossoms.\"\n\n- Ding Ling",

His school eschewed punishments and rewards, and encouraged practical experience over academic study.\n\nIn mid-1909, Ferrer was arrested and accused of orchestrating a week of insurrection known as Barcelona's \"Tragic Week\". He was convicted in a show trial and executed by firing squad on October 13th, 1909.

After a union he founded petitioned the King for universal suffrage and legal equality, Thrane was imprisoned.\n\nBorn into a bourgeois family, Thrane was orphaned at the early age of 15 and spent the rest of his youth studying abroad in Europe. He returned to Norway, working as an educator.\n\nIn 1848, Thrane began working as the editor of the local newspaper Drammens Adresse. Inspired by the February Revolution in France, Thrane expressed radical political opinions and was dismissed from the position after less than a year.\n\nAround this time, Thrane founded the Drammens arbeiderforening (Drammen Labour Union) and began publishing the union's paper. Between 1849-50, the trade union movement (also called the Thranite Movement) grew very quickly, to approximately 30,000 members.\n\nMembers of the Thranite Movement were both urban and rural - both small farmers in the countryside and urban craftsmen participated.\n\nThis trade union movement is often associated with a petition presented to King Oscar I on May 19th, 1850. The petition, backed by nearly 13,000 signatures, demanded universal suffrage, abolition of protective tariffs, reform of the public school, and improvement of householders ' conditions.\n\nOver the following years, this growing labor movement was repressed by the state - its leadership, including Thrane, were surveilled, arrested on false charges, and imprisoned. These tactics successfully broke the Thranite Movement, and Thrane himself left Norway for the U.S. in 1863.\n\nIn 1890, Thrane died in Wisconsin. His remains were returned to Norway in 1949, and he is buried in the \u00c6reslunden at V\u00e5r Frelser's cemetery in Oslo.",

In this role, he became a kind of \"Robin Hood\", raising money from employers under threat of reprisals, liberating prisoners, destroying property deeds and police archives, and burning villas of the rich.\n\nLater in life, after the Nazis began to come into power, he moved to Soviet Russia. There, however, he became a dissident, criticizing bad working conditions in the country. On September 15th, 1933, he died in a \"boating accident\", which is speculated by anarchist historian Nick Heath to actually have been an NKVD assassination.",

        "description": "On this day in 1966, in the wake of spontaneous riots against police brutality, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton founded the Black Panther Party in Oakland, California.\n\nIn an interview recorded for the 1990 documentary \"Eyes on the Prize II\", Seale described the founding of the BPP in his own words:\n\n\"Black Panther Party, 1966, when Huey and I founded that organization, that particular year, numerous acts of police brutality had sparked a lot of spontaneous riots, something that Huey and I were against, the spontaneous riots.\n\nEven a year earlier, in 1965, in Watts, you know, sixty-five people were killed, 200 wounded, 5,000 arrested. And Huey and I began to try to figure out how could we organize 5,000 youthful Black folks into some kind of political-electorial power movement.\n\nStokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] was on the scene with Black Power. We were questioning, Huey and I, about the need for a functional definition of power and we came up with this, that 'power is the ability to define phenomena then in turn make it act in a desired manner.'\n\nWith the phenomena of racism structured in the city council at that time, Huey and I working with the North Oakland Neighborhood Service Center, the advisory board, we got 5,000 signatures for them to go to the city council, to get the city council to try to set up a police review board to deal with complaints of police brutality. Well, the city council ignored them.\n\nSo, that phenomena was that the city council was just a racist structure which could care less about the forty-eight percent Black and Chicano people who lived in the city of Oakland. So, there we are trying to figure out what to do. We finally concluded through those months that we had to start a new organization.\n\nAnd we sit down and began to write out this Ten-Point Platform and Program in the North Oakland Neighborhood Service Center in North Oakland, California, in the community where Huey and I lived. And we wrote out this program.\n\n'We want power to determine our own destiny in our own Black community', alluding to the needs to be organized-political electoral power. Full employment, decent housing, decent education that taught us about our true selves, not to have to fight in Vietnam, immediate end to police brutality and murder of back people was point number seven.\n\nThe right to have juries of our peers in the courts, what have you. We summed it up. We wanted land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice, and peace. And, in the tail end, we stuck in two famous paragraphs: 'When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to separate themself from the political bondage' - that was the emphasis, the political bondage - 'which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the Earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's God entitled them.'\n\nI mean, this was the kind of summarization we gave to our meaning. And we summarized that Ten-Point Platform Program, flipped a coin to see who would be chairman. I won chairman and we created the Black Panther Party.\"",

He immediately launched programs for social, ecological and economic change and renamed the country from the French colonial name Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (\"Land of Incorruptible People\"), with its people being called Burkinab\u00e9 (\"upright people\").\n\nSankara's administration refused foreign aid to remain politically independent, with him stating \"Imperialism often occurs in more subtle forms, a loan, food aid, blackmail\". He also began nationalizing land and mineral wealth and promoted literacy, women's rights, and public health.\n\nOn this day in 1987, Sankara was assassinated by troops led by Blaise Compaor\u00e9, who assumed leadership of the state shortly after having Sankara killed. A week before his murder, Sankara had declared: \"While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas\".",

        "description": "Enver Hoxha, born on this day in 1908, was the communist leader of Albania from 1946 to 1985, leaving behind a complex legacy of feminism and greatly improved access to healthcare and education, coupled with what critics perceive as a paranoid personality cult and brutal state repression.\n\nHoxha is also known for having sharp ideological and political disagreements with the Soviet Union and communist Yugoslavia, siding most strongly with and receiving aid from Maoist China.\n\nBefore coming into power, Hoxha was a French school teacher and librarian, becoming a communist partisan after fascist Italy invaded Albania in 1939. In March 1943, the first National Conference of the Communist Party elected Hoxha formally as First Secretary.\n\nIt was in this position as First Secretary that Hoxha became head of state after the Albanian monarchy was abolished in 1946.\n\nIn the years after Stalin's death, Hoxha grew increasingly distressed by the policies of the Soviet leadership and of Khrushchev in particular. China was also disillusioned with Soviet behavior at this time, and Hoxha found common ground with Mao Zedong's criticisms of Moscow. By 1961, Hoxha's attacks on the \"revisionist\" Soviet leadership had so infuriated Khrushchev that he elected first to terminate Moscow's economic aid to Albania and ultimately to sever diplomatic relations entirely.\n\nUnder Hoxha's leadership, the Albanian literacy rate improved from 5-10% in rural areas to more 90%. Hoxha was also a proponent of women's rights, stating \"the entire party and country should hurl into the fire and break the neck of anyone who dared trample underfoot the sacred edict of the party on the defense of women's rights\". Accordingly, more than 175 times as many women attended secondary schools in 1978 than had done so in 1938.\n\nCritics of Hoxha point out that his reign had state repression of dissidents reminiscent of the Soviet Union and what they perceived as a paranoid personality cult. The 1992 book \"Albania: A Country Study\", commissioned by the U.S. government, alleged that one out of three Albanians had either been interrogated by the Sigurimi secret police or incarcerated in labor camps.\n\nHoxha died in 1985, leading Ramiz Alia to succeed him as head of state. Although Albania was one of the poorest European nations at the time of his death, the country was also economically self-sufficient, carrying minimal foreign debt and boasting a trade surplus of $10 million.\n\n\"Every departure from class struggle has fatal results for the destiny of socialism.\"\n\n- Enver Hoxha",

Kautsky was one of the most authoritative proponents of Orthodox Marxism after the death of Friedrich Engels in 1895 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, including during the Second International.\n\nKautsky founded the important socialist journal \"Neue Zeit\". Following the war, Kautsky was an outspoken critic of the Bolshevik Revolution, engaging in polemics with Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Joseph Stalin on the nature of the Soviet state. Towards the end of his life, he became close friends with Rosa Luxemburg.\n\nOf the USSR, he famously wrote \"Foreign tourists in Russia stand in silent amazement before the gigantic enterprises created there, as they stand before the pyramids, for example. Only seldom does the thought occur to them what enslavement, what lowering of human self-esteem was connected with the construction of those gigantic establishments.\"\n\nFor his part, Lenin excoriated Kautsky's interpretations of Marxist thought stating \"Kautsky has beaten the world record in the liberal distortion of Marx.\" (see Lenin's essay \"How Kautsky Turned Marx Into A Common Liberal\").\n\nKautsky is notable for, in addition to his anti-Bolshevik polemics, his editing and publication of Marx's Capital, Volume IV (usually published as \"Theories of Surplus Value\").",

The law was finally killed in 1997, when it was declared unconstitutional.

Labor activist Clinton Jencks, who was the union's business agent, was arrested on strike and kept in solitary confinement for 16 months. After the company got a court injunction forbidding picketers to return to the picket line, the workers' wives and children took their place.\n\nAfter 15 months of protest, the company came to an agreement with the striking workers on January 21st, 1952, giving the strikers nearly everything they asked for. The strike drew national attention, and, after it was settled in 1952, a movie entitled \"Salt of the Earth\" (1954) was released that offered a fictionalized version of events.",

After 37 years of denial and censorship of the press, the French government finally acknowledged 40 deaths in 1998, although there are estimates of 100 to 300 victims.",

Six people were killed, and the event became known as the \"Columbine Massacre\".\n\nThe owner of the Rocky Mountain Fuel Company, Josephine Roche, brought an end to the strike several weeks after the incident at Columbine by declaring that the company union was to be affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and recognizing the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA).

Following his death, President Ronald Reagan invaded Grenada, toppling the revolutionary government.\n\nBishop headed the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada from 1979 until 1983, when he was dismissed from his post and shot in a coup, leading to civil unrest and a U.S. invasion of the country.\n\nAlthough Bishop grew up in Grenada, he left to study in London as a young adult. While there, Bishop acquired a law degree and studied the works of Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Julius Nyerere.\n\nIn 1970, he returned to Grenada and was active politically, representing striking nurses in court and helping lead the \"New Jewel Movement\". The New Jewel Movement ultimately put him in power when, in 1979, the movement successfully led a coup against Eric Gairy and Bishop became the Prime Minister of Grenada.\n\nAmong Bishop's core principles were workers' rights, women's rights, and the struggle against racism and apartheid. Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave, and sex discrimination was made illegal. Organizations to promote education, health care, youth affairs, and literacy were also established. Due to his administration's efforts, illiteracy and unemployment greatly declined.\n\nIn 1983, power struggles within the party culminated in Bishop and seven members of his cabinet being captured and executed by forces led by Bernard Coard.\n\nAfter Bishop's murder, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and Grenada's governor-general Paul Scoon appealed to the United States for help. Within the month, Ronald Reagan launched an invasion of Grenada.\n\n\"The Grenadian Revolution is 'even worse' - I'm using their language - than the Cuban and Nicaraguan Revolutions because the people of Grenada and the leadership of Grenada speak English and can communicate directly with the people of the United States.\n\n...The people of Grenada and the leadership of Grenada are predominantly black...And if we have 95% of predominantly African origin in our country, we can have a dangerous appeal to 30 million black people in the United States.\"\n\n- Maurice Bishop, discussing a secret U.S. State Department report on the Grenadian Revolution",

The bombing was blamed on Italian anarchists, and Pinelli was detained along with many other leftists, including Pietro Valpreda, who was falsely convicted and served eighteen years in prison.\n\nJust before midnight on December 15th, 1969, Pinelli fell to his death from a fourth floor window of the Milan police station. Three police officers interrogating Pinelli, including Commissioner Luigi Calabresi, were put under investigation in 1971 for his death, but legal proceedings concluded it was due to accidental causes.\n\nCalabresi was later gunned down at his home in 1972, for which leftist Italian journalist Adriano Sofri was convicted in 1990.",

Although the Seminole was victorious in some of the battles of the Second Seminole War, it was on this day in 1837 that General Joseph Hern\u00e1ndez captured Osceola, who had come to meet Hern\u00e1ndez under the false promise of peace talks.\n\nGeneral Hern\u00e1ndez had agreed to meet with Osceola under a white flag of truce, but promptly arrested Osceola and 81 of his followers. Osceola died from illness a few months after his capture, on January 30th, 1838.",

        "description": "Bobby Seale, born on this day in 1936, was, with Huey Newton, a founding member of the Black Panther Party. \"The people have now come to realize that the only way to deal with the oppressor is to deal on our own terms and this was done.\"\n\nWhile studying at Merritt Community College, Seale joined the Afro-American Association (AAA), a group on the campus devoted to self-education about African and African-American history. Through the AAA group, Seale met Huey Newton.\n\nIn an interview recorded for the 1990 documentary \"Eyes on the Prize II\", Seale described the founding of the BPP in his own words:\n\n\"Black Panther Party, 1966, when Huey and I founded that organization, that particular year, numerous acts of police brutality had sparked a lot of spontaneous riots, something that Huey and I were against, the spontaneous riots.\n\n...\n\nAnd we sit down and began to write out this Ten-Point Platform and Program in the North Oakland Neighborhood Service Center in North Oakland, California, in the community where Huey and I lived. And we wrote out this program.\n\n'We want power to determine our own destiny in our own Black community', alluding to the needs to be organized-political electoral power. Full employment, decent housing, decent education that taught us about our true selves, not to have to fight in Vietnam, immediate end to police brutality and murder of back people was point number seven.\n\nThe right to have juries of our peers in the courts, what have you. We summed it up. We wanted land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice, and peace. And, in the tail end, we stuck in two famous paragraphs: 'When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to separate themself from the political bondage' - that was the emphasis, the political bondage - 'which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the Earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's God entitled them.'\n\nI mean, this was the kind of summarization we gave to our meaning. And we summarized that Ten-Point Platform Program, flipped a coin to see who would be chairman. I won chairman and we created the Black Panther Party.\"\n\nBobby Seale was also one of the original \"Chicago Eight\" defendants charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot in the wake of protests during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nDuring the trial, Seale, the only black member of the Chicago Eight, was repeatedly bound and gagged. Although he was ultimately not convicted, Seale was sentenced to four years in prison for contempt of court.\n\nIn 1973, Seale ran for Mayor of Oakland, California. He received the second-most votes in a field of nine candidates, but ultimately lost in a run-off with incumbent Mayor John Reading.\n\nAmong Seale's works are Seize the Time: The Story of The Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton (1970), A Lonely Rage: The Autobiography of Bobby Seale (1978), and Power to the People: The World of the Black Panthers (2016).",

Reed served as a war correspondent, covered strikes, interviewed Pancho Villa, and was an eyewitness to the October Revolution.\n\nReed first gained prominence as a war correspondent during the first World War, and later became best known for his coverage of the October Revolution in Petrograd, Russia, which he wrote about in the book \"Ten Days That Shook the World\".\n\nAs the U.S. entered World War I, Reed was marginalized for his anti-war sentiments and set sail with his partner Bryant from New York to Europe. The pair were going as working journalists to report on the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. They were in Petrograd for the October Revolution. Reed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new revolutionary socialist government, and met both Leon Trotsky and Lenin while there.\n\nReed subsequently made a trip back to the U.S., where he vehemently defended the new Soviet Republic and was arrested three times, the last for violating the Sedition Act. After being acquitted, Reed returned to the USSR and again met with Lenin and Trotsky.\n\nReed died from spotted typhus while trying to return to the United States in 1920. He was given a state funeral and buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.",

        "description": "On this day in 1956, a rebellion broke out in Budapest against the Soviet-aligned Hungarian People's Republic. The uprising was the first major threat to Soviet control since the Red Army drove Nazi Germany from its territory at the End of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe revolt began as a student protest, which attracted thousands as they marched through central Budapest to the Hungarian Parliament building. Protesters were fired upon from within the building by the State Security Police, killing multiple students.\n\nAs news of the violence spread, disorder and violence erupted throughout the capital, including the lynching of communist organizers and release and arming of anti-communist political prisoners.\n\nAs the rebellion grew, the government quickly collapsed. Thousands of people organized militias, battling state police and Soviet troops. Insurgents took control of workers' councils from the ruling Hungarian Working People's Party and demanded political reforms.\n\nOn November 4th, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. The Soviet government justified the suppression by taking the position that the uprising was fascist in character, although this claim has been disputed by historians such as Peter Fryer, author of \"Hungarian Tragedy\" and eyewitness to the uprising.\n\nOver 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were killed in the conflict, and 200,000 Hungarians fled as refugees. Mass arrests and denunciations continued for months thereafter, and suppression of the revolution continued for decades afterward.\n\nThese Soviet actions, while strengthening control over the Eastern Bloc, alienated many Western Marxists, leading to splits and/or considerable losses of membership for communist parties in capitalist states.\n\nImre Nagy, a communist political leader during the crisis who embraced some of the insurgent's proposed reforms, was secretly captured, convicted of organizing the overthrow of the Hungarian People's Republic, and executed.\n\nIn 1989, Nagy was politically rehabilitated and re-buried. Approximately 200,000 people attended the ceremony, one of the events that marked an end to communism in Hungary. At the inauguration of the Third Hungarian Republic in 1989, October 23rd was declared a national holiday.\n\nThe uprising is celebrated by right-wing forces today; in 2006, President Bush sent George Pataki, the governor of New York, to Budapest to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution.",

Among the reasons given for going on strike were pay inequality, lack of women in union leadership, and a general lack of recognition for the value and skill of domestic labor.\n\nDuring the work stoppage, also known as \"Women's Day Off\", 25,000 people gathered in Reykjavik, Iceland's capital city, for a rally. There, women listened to speakers, sang, and talked to each other about what could be done to achieve gender equality in Iceland.\n\nWomen from many different backgrounds spoke, including a housewife, two members of parliament, and a worker.

The operation also caused the deaths of at least twenty-four civilians, eighteen of whom were killed when the U.S. Navy bombed a mental hospital.\n\nPresident Reagan justified the invasion by claiming to be acting in the interests of 600 U.S. medical students on the island. Historian Howard Zinn has noted that there was no evidence these students were in danger and that, in the same period, Reagan's administration was actively supporting the government of El Salvador, which had already killed American citizens.\n\nThe invasion drew widespread condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly voted 108 to 9 in condemning the act as \"a flagrant violation of international law\". Margaret Thatcher publicly supported the action, but opposed it in private, telling President Reagan directly:\n\n\"This action will be seen as intervention by a Western country in the internal affairs of a small independent nation, however unattractive its regime. I ask you to consider this in the context of our wider East/West relations and of the fact that we will be having in the next few days to present to our Parliament and people the siting of Cruise missiles in this country...You asked for my advice.

She had no access to education due to her lack of resources, and learned Spanish while working as a housemaid.\n\nIn 1930, Cacuango was among the leaders of the historic workers' strike at the Pesillo hacienda in Cayambe, which was a milestone for indigenous and peasant rights. During the Glorious May Revolution in Ecuador, Cacuango personally led an assault on a government military base.\n\nThe same year, with the help of Ecuador's Communist Party, Cacuango co-founded the Indigenous Federation of Ecuador (FEI), an early group in the fight for indigenous rights. She also helped establish some of the first bilingual indigenous schools.",

        "description": "On this day in 1977, a district team of officers raided Hounslow hospital in West London, cutting phone lines and removing patients from the facility. Workers had been occupying the facility since March to prevent its closure.\n\nHounslow Hospital was a small facility for geriatric and long-stay patients in an industrial area. The hospital was considered a home as well as a place for treatment. \n\nHounslow's closure was announced by the state in January 1977 and scheduled for August. A hospital staff occupation started as a \"work-in\" in March, intent on exploiting a legal loophole where, if the hospital has patients, the law mandates the hospital be funded.\n\nManagement tried to transfer staff, and threatened those who refused with sanctions and firing. The threats did not succeed, and the work-in continued beyond the scheduled closing date.\n\nOn this day in 1977, a district team of officers raided Hounslow hospital to evict occupying workers, cutting phone lines and removing patients from the facility. Beds and furniture were wrecked, the floor strewn with food, torn mattresses, sheets, and personal articles.\n\nIn this manner, the hospital was closed by force. The raid provoked a public outcry and led directly a year-long occupation of the closed hospital. 2000 striking hospital workers picketed the Ealing, Hammersmith, and Hounslow Area Health Authority (AHA) to protest the raid and demand that the hospital be reopened. When the occupation ended, work began on redesigning the facilities into a new community hospital/health center.",

His subsequent imprisonment led to the \"Free Huey!\" campaign; Newton was freed on August 5th, 1970.\n\nHuey Newton was a revolutionary activist who, along with fellow Merritt College student Bobby Seale, co-founded the Black Panther Party (BPP). In the 1960s, under their leadership, the BPP founded over 60 community support programs, including food banks, free medical clinics, legal advice seminars, clothing banks, housing co-ops, and their own ambulance service.\n\nOn October 28th, 1967, Newton was wounded in a shootout with police. The incident occurred after he was pulled over by Oakland cop John Frey, who called for backup after realizing who Newton was. When a second officer arrived, shots rang out; Frey was killed, while Newton and the other officer were wounded.\n\nThe \"Free Huey!\" campaign began in December, the phrase originating out a coalition between the BPP and the Peace and Freedom Party. The trial, which began on July 15th, 1968, quickly ascended beyond the scope of Newton himself.\n\nNewton was initially convicted of voluntary manslaughter in September 1968. In May 1970, the California Appellate Court reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial. The charges were finally dismissed by the Alameda County Superior Court, and Huey was freed on August 5th, 1970.\n\n\"If you so much as touch a hair on Huey's pretty head, you better give your soul to the Lord because your ass belongs to the Black Panther Party.\"\n\n- Earl Anthony, Spitting in the Wind\n\n\"Yeah they freed Huey. Then Huey came out and they wanted Huey to free them and I keep trying to tell the people, I say people, that's the true power of the people, you freed me, you freed Huey, now why don't you all go ahead and free yourself?\n\nBut see, they can't do that can they? They can't do that cause the people always have to create what they call a leader and a leader is everything that the people want to be but the leader is everything that the people can never be so then when the leader fails, he's gonna fail, he's just flesh and blood, he's gonna fail, when the leader fails then the whole construction of the concept of leadership fails and then it just becomes a matter of contempt.\n\nAnd that's when they assassinate you and then put your image on a postage stamp so they can keep lickin' you in the grave.\"\n\n- Huey Newton",

In 1908, during the FLT convention, Capetillo asked the union to approve a policy for women's suffrage, insisting that all women should have the same right to vote as men. Along with other labor activists, she also helped pass a minimum wage law in the Puerto Rican Legislature.\n\nToday, Capetillo is perhaps best known for being arrested for wearing pants in public, although the charges against her were later dropped.\n\nIn 2014, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico honored Capetillo, along with eleven other women, with plaques in the \"La Plaza en Honor a la Mujer Puertorrique\u00f1a\" (Plaza in Honor of Puerto Rican Women).",

The murder led to a widespread crackdown on left wing movements across the country.\n\nCzolgosz (1873 - 1901) was a socialist from a young age, working in factories and mills as a teenager and witnessing labor strife firsthand. He was greatly inspired by Emma Goldman, and met her briefly after a lecture she gave in Cleveland. Czolgosz's direct inspiration to assassinate a national leader possibly came from the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy by anarchist Gaetano Bresci in 1900.\n\nOn September 6th, 1901, Czolgosz shot President William McKinley on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. McKinley died eight days later of gangrene caused by the wounds and was succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt in office.\n\nCzolgosz was tried and found guilty just over a month later. Before his execution, Czolgosz explained \"I killed the President because he was the enemy of the good people - the good working people...I am not sorry for my crime\".\n\nIn the aftermath of the assassination, there was a series of strong reprisals against the anarchist movement. Several anarchists, including Emma Goldman, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack, and vigilantes attacked anarchist colonies and newspapers.\n\nFear of the movement also led to government creating anarchist surveillance programs, which were eventually consolidated on a federal level when the Bureau of Investigation (BOI, later to become the FBI) was formed in 1908.",

After being sentenced to death, Turner was asked if he regretted his actions. He responded \"Was Christ not crucified?\"\n\nTurner (1800 - 1831) was born and raised in Southampton County, Virginia, an area where black people outnumbered whites. He learned how to read and write at a young age and was deeply religious, eventually becoming an influential preacher in the area.\n\nIn early 1831, on the basis of religious visions, Nat Turner began preparing a slave insurrection. The rebellion began on August 21st, and rebels traveled from house to house, freeing slaves and killing many of the white people that they encountered.\n\nAt least 55 white people were killed, and the slaves killed men, women, and children. The group spared a few homes \"because Turner believed the poor white inhabitants 'thought no better of themselves than they did of negroes'\".\n\nThe rebellion was put down by a combined force of local militia and three companies of artillery. The state executed 56 black people, and militias killed at least 100 more, some of whom were not involved in the rebellion.\n\nTurner went on the run, eluding capture for six weeks. On this day in 1831, a white farmer discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. After being tried and convicted for \"conspiring to rebel and making insurrection\", he was asked if he regretted what he had done. Turner responded \"Was Christ not crucified?\"\n\nTurner was hanged on November 11th, 1831. His body was dissected and flayed, with his bones and skin being used to create trophies and souvenirs, such as purses.\n\nAfter Turner's execution, state legislatures passed new laws prohibiting education of slaves and free black people, restricting rights of assembly and other civil liberties for free black people, and requiring white ministers to be present at all worship services.",

The raid took place in the context of the \"Coal Creek War\", a militant labor uprising in the early 1890s.\n\nThe Coal Creek War took place primarily, but not exclusively, in Anderson County, Tennessee. This labor conflict ignited in 1891 when coal mine owners in the Coal Creek watershed began to remove and replace their company-employed, private coal miners then on the payroll with convict laborers leased out by the Tennessee state prison system, used in this case as strikebreakers.\n\nCoal workers at the Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC) went on strike on April 1st, 1891, demanding to be paid in cash, not scrip (currency only usable at company stores) and to be allowed to check the weight of their haul (they were paid by weight, but not allowed to check the company's measurement).\n\nWorkers initiated a series of raids against the TCMC - on July 14th, armed miners surrounded the stockades where leased convicts were held and sent them by train out of the city. On October 31st, 1891, the miners burned company stockades to the ground and freed hundreds of convicts being held there. On Nov. 2nd, another band attacked stockades in a different location and freed those prisoners as well. From those two events alone, at least 453 convicts were set free.\n\nThe strike was forcibly put down by state militia, ending with the arrest of hundreds of miners. All but one were either acquitted or merely fined. Tennessee ended its policy of leasing convict labor, using convicts to work in state-owned mines instead.",

The day before the strike, the factory manager had fired the elected shop steward in response workers' attempts to organize through the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU).\n\nWhen arriving to work the next day, workers refused to work, demanding the reinstatement of their elected representative. The boss then demanded union workers leave, and then fighting broke out. The union members then gathered outside the gate and were attacked by police.\n\nThe following day, the sacked workers and around 100 supporters again gathered outside the warehouse, attempting to block the access road and again clashing with police. The labor disputes continued for months. After two weeks, an Industrial Tribunal initiated by TGWU ruled that the workers had been sacked for union membership, and ordered them to return to work February 26th.\n\nDespite this apparent victory, when 35 workers returned to their jobs, they were told that their union would not be recognized and that they be forced to work from 5 AM until midnight. This caused another strike, however it was short-lived and ineffective. Only 12 out of the original 42 fired JJ workers returned to work on March 18th.",

Others used words like \"insurrection\" and \"Bolshevik revolution\". Because of this propaganda and the Attorney General's injunction against the strike, the UMW called the strike off on November 8th.\n\nMany workers ignored this order, however, and the strike continued for over a month, with a final agreement being reached on December 10th.

        "description": "On this day in 1970, Salvador Allende became the first Marxist to serve as elected leader of a Latin American liberal democracy. \"We are seeking to overcome [the bourgeois state]...Our objective is total, scientific, Marxist socialism.\"\n\nAs President, Allende sought to nationalize major industries, expand education and improve the living standards of the working class. Specific examples of his policies include giving educational grants to indigenous children, literacy programs in impoverished areas, and establishing a minimum wage for workers of all ages.\n\nOn September 11th, 1973, the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'\u00e9tat assisted by the Henry Kissinger and the CIA. As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, he gave his last speech vowing not to resign. Later that day, Allende died of suicide with a gun, according to an investigation conducted by a Chilean court with the assistance of international experts in 2011.\n\nFollowing Allende's death, General Augusto Pinochet refused to return authority to a civilian government, and Chile was later ruled by a military junta that was in power up until 1990. This junta dissolved the Congress of Chile, suspended the Constitution, and began a persecution of alleged dissidents, in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed.\n\n\"As for the bourgeois state, at the present moment, we are seeking to overcome it, to overthrow it.\u2026 Our objective is total, scientific, Marxist socialism.\"\n\n- Salvador Allende, as quoted in Conversations With Allende (1970) by French philosopher R\u00e9gis Debray",

A U.S. flag was torn from the ambassador's residence and trampled by the crowd.\n\nThe demonstrations were influenced by former foreign minister Aquilino Boyd, who threatened a \"peaceful invasion\" of the American-controlled Panama Canal Zone to raise the flag of the republic there as tangible evidence of Panama's sovereignty over the territory, which had been under the control of the United States since 1903.\n\nFearful that Panamanian mobs might actually force entry into the Canal Zone, the United States government put troops on the ground. Several hundred Panamanians crossed barbed-wire restraints and clashed with Canal Zone police and U.S. soldiers.\n\nExtensive and violent disorder followed. A mob smashed the windows of the United States Information Agency library. The United States flag was torn from the ambassador's residence and trampled, and the U.S. embassy was attacked. Stones were thrown against the troops, who were dispersed by tear gas.\n\nThese riots were a prequel to the deadlier and more prominent Flag Protest of 1964, which led to the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which granted independence to the Canal Zone.",

        "description": "On this day in 2003, a wildcat strike involving two-thirds of Royal Mail workers in the United Kingdom (around 20,000 people) ended in victory for the striking mail carriers.\n\nIn August of that year, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) called for a national strike for higher wages, however the proposition we defeated in a close vote. A few months later, in late October, postal workers engaged in a wildcat strike of their own, indicating a lack of trust between union rank-and-file and leadership.\n\nThe strike began when a driver in Dartford, London was sacked and 400 co-workers engaged in a spontaneous work stoppage. Within eleven days, 20,000 to 25,000 workers were out, mostly from London and the South East. More than 16 million letters per day were piling up and, after a few days, 10,000 post boxes across London were sealed off.\n\nOn November 3rd, after the management promised that there would be no repression, sackings or local deals, the strike was resolved. On the aims of the workers and why the strike was successful, one worker commented:\n\n\"It was a defensive, but successful strike. The issue is we broke the anti strike legislation. In this case even the headquarters union official were not trying very hard to enforce the law and the local union reps were actively working against the law. We broke through the unions officials 'anti-strike' politics again, and we were successful when we did.\"",

The bombing took place during the Salad Bowl strike, the largest farm workers strike in U.S. history, which had begun on August 23rd of that year.\n\nThe Salad Bowl strike was in part a protest against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters winning legal jurisdiction over farm workers in California (the UFW had previously organized these workers). The Salad Bowl Strike caused the price of lettuce to double practically overnight, and lettuce growers lost $500,000 a day.\n\nDuring the strike UFW leader C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez was arrested and imprisoned. When he was visited by athlete Rafer Johnson and Ethel Kennedy, widow of slain Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Johnson and Kennedy were attacked by an anti-union mob on the steps of the jail and police had to suppress the quarrel.\n\nAlthough the strike ended on March 26th, 1971 when the Teamsters and UFW signed a new jurisdictional agreement reaffirming the UFW's right to organize field workers, jurisdictional labor disputes (and associated violence) would continue for years afterward. These tensions led directly to the passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975.",

Kelley, \"[Robinson's] monumental Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition (1983) takes Karl Marx to task for failing to comprehend radical movements outside of Europe. He rewrites the history of the West from ancient times to the mid-twentieth century, scrutinizing the idea that Marx\u2019s categories of class can be universally applied outside of Europe. Instead he characterized black rebellions as expressions of what he called the 'Black Radical Tradition', movements whose objectives and aspirations confounded Western social analysis. Marxism also failed to account for the racial character of capitalism.\"\n\nIn a critical review of the work, authors William I. Robinson, Salvador Rangel and Hilbourne A. Watson state \"Black Marxism has become a favored text with which to badger radical intellectuals and activists who place a premium on proletarian struggle. This has led some among left organizers to fear they may be condemned as Eurocentric, as 'class reductionists', and as 'ignoring race' should they place a premium on class analysis, should they insist that racism is an outcome of class exploitation, and that its eradication involves a transnational and pan-ethnic proletarian struggle against capitalism...At a time when global capital is on an all-out rampage against the global working and popular classes and when our very survival is under threat, we need more than ever a transnational revolutionary proletarian politics. We won\u2019t find that in Black Marxism.\"\n\n\"Racism, I maintain, was not simply a convention for ordering the relations of European to non-European peoples but has its genesis in the 'internal' relations of European peoples.\"\n\n- Cedric Robinson",

He was also a candidate for United States Congress from his native state Indiana in 1916.\n\nDebs was noted for his fiery oration. In 1918, Debs was arrested after giving a speech denouncing American participation in World War I. He was convicted under the Sedition Act of 1918 and sentenced to a term of 10 years. In his speech to the court, Debs provided one of his most well-known quotes:\n\n\"Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.\"",

        "description": "Michael Schwerner, born on this day in 1939, was one of three Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) field/social workers killed in Philadelphia, Mississippi by members of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nIn the early 1960s Schwerner became active in working for civil rights for black people; he led a local Congress of Racial Equality group on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, called \"Downtown CORE.\" He participated in a 1963 effort to desegregate Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in Maryland. As activism increased in the South, Schwerner and his wife Rita Schwerner Bender volunteered to work for National CORE in Mississippi, helping black people exercise their right to vote.\n\nMichael Scwerner and fellow civil rights workers James Chaney and Andrew Goodman were killed near the town of Philadelphia, Mississippi while investigating the burning of Mt. Zion Methodist Church, which had been a site for a CORE Freedom School.\n\nArrested by the local sheriff, the trio was released that evening without being allowed to contact anyone. On the road, they were stopped by patrol lights and two carloads of KKK members, kidnapped, tortured, and killed.\n\nThe sheriff, along with six others, were indicted and convicted for depriving the three men of their civil rights. No one was held accountable for their murders until 2005, when outspoken white supremacist Edgar Ray Killen was convicted on three counts of manslaughter.",

He was also a vital leading figure in the Red victory in the Russian Civil War and one of the seven members of the first Politburo.\n\nAfter the rise of Joseph Stalin, Trotsky was removed from his positions and eventually expelled from the Soviet Union in February 1929. He spent the rest of his life in exile, and was assassinated in 1940 in Mexico City by Ram\u00f3n Mercader, a Soviet agent.\n\nTrotsky was a prolific author whose works include History of the Russian Revolution (1930) and The Revolution Betrayed (1936).

After the anarchist movement was defeated by the Bolsheviks, Makhno fled to Paris with his family.\n\nMakhno and his supporters attempted to reorganize social and economic life along anarchist principles, including the establishment of communes on former landed estates, the requisition and egalitarian redistribution of land to the peasants, and the organization of free elections to local soviets (councils) and regional congresses.\n\nAlthough Makhno considered the Bolsheviks a threat to the development of an anarchist Free Territory within Ukraine, he entered into formal military alliances twice with the Red Army to defeat the White Army. In the aftermath of the White Army's defeat in Crimea in November 1920, the Bolsheviks initiated a military campaign against Makhno. After an extended period of open resistance against the Red Army, Makhno fled across the Romanian border in August 1921.\n\nIn exile, Makhno settled in Paris with his wife Halyna and daughter Yelena. While there, Makhno wrote numerous memoirs and articles for radical newspapers before dying there at the age of 45 from tuberculosis-related causes.\n\n\"I would still call on you, reader and brother, to take up the struggle for the ideal anarchism, for only if you fight for this ideal and uphold it will you understand it properly.\"\n\n- Nestor Makhno",

The name \"October Revolution\" comes from the fact that the revolution began on October 25th in the dating convention of the time.\n\nLed by the Bolshevik Party, the revolution took place through an armed insurrection in Petrograd and was instrumental in the larger Russian Revolution of 1917 - 1923. By November 8th, the Winter Palace, the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia, had been captured.\n\nElections were held on November 12th. In contrast to their majority in the soviets (local council governments), the Bolsheviks only won 175 seats in the 715-seat legislative body, coming in second behind the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which won 370 seats.\n\nOn its first and only day in session, the Constituent Assembly came into conflict with the soviets, and it rejected soviet decrees on peace and land, resulting in the Constituent Assembly being dissolved by the Bolsheviks in January.\n\nThe political situation devolved into a civil war between the Bolsheviks, Whites (counter-revolutionaries), Makhnovists, independence movements, and other socialist factions.\n\nThe Bolsheviks eventually defeated all rival parties and formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922. Their victory marked the beginning of Marxism-Leninism as a global force.",

Though 556 people were deported in total, including many prominent leftist leaders like Emma Goldman, Palmer's efforts were largely frustrated by officials at the U.S. Department of Labor, which had authority for deportations and objected to the methods used.\n\nDuring the first raid on November 7th, agents of the Bureau of Investigation working with local police executed a series of well-publicized and violent raids against the Union of Russian Workers in twelve cities.

It was aimed at those suffering the most in the depths of the Great Depression, \"those who think there is no hope for the future\", and announced to them that \"the Catholic Church has a social program...there are men of God who are working not only for their spiritual but for their material welfare.\" It accepted no advertising and did not pay its staff.\n\nLike many newspapers of the day, including those for which Day had already been writing, the Catholic Worker was an unapologetic example of advocacy journalism. It provided coverage of strikes, explored working conditions, especially of women and black workers, and explicated papal teaching on social issues.\n\nIts viewpoint was partisan and stories were designed to move its readers to take action locally, for example, by patronizing laundries recommended by the Laundry Workers' Union. Its advocacy of federal child labor laws put it at odds with the American Church hierarchy from its first issue.\n\nDay's activism continued throughout the rest of her life, resulting in multiple arrests. In the summer of 1973, she joined C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez in his campaign for farm laborers in the fields of California. She was also arrested at the age of 75 for defying a ban on picketing, spending ten days in jail.\n\n\"The Gospel takes away our right forever, to discriminate between the deserving and the undeserving poor.\"\n\n- Dorothy Day",

The New Orleans Board of Trade announced it would sign contracts agreeing to the terms - but only with the white unions, however this offer was steadfastly refused.\n\nEventually, other union leaders in the city began calling for a strike in support of the Triple Alliance, and, on this day in 1892, a multi-racial coalition of 25,000 workers across the entire city went on strike. Efforts by the city to find strikebreaking workers, both from within and outside of New Orleans, failed.\n\nAfter just three days, the Board of Trade agreed to binding arbitration to settle the strike, with employers agreeing to sit down with both white and black union leaders.

Within hours of Rath's death, the Kristallnacht was launched against Jewish communities in Germany.\n\nJewish homes, hospitals, and schools were ransacked as attackers demolished buildings with sledgehammers. Rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland. Over 7,000 Jewish businesses were damaged or destroyed, and 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and incarcerated in concentration camps.\n\nEstimates of the amount of people killed vary from 91 to as high as 638. Historians view Kristallnacht as a prelude to the Final Solution and the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust.",

Women in the local neighborhoods prevented CSN vans from picking up their husbands to work with pickets on the street, and the Residents Associations carried out barricades so that CSN busses and other transport could not run while the company was refusing to negotiate with workers.\n\nThe conflict on November 9th began when about 600 state soldiers descended on Avenida Independ\u00eancia, in front of CSN, throwing tear gas bombs at a crowd of workers. The crowd responded with by attacking sticks and stones. Three people were killed, and thirty-one were wounded. A monument dedicated to the victims of the violence was later partially destroyed with bombs.\n\nIn spite of this violence, workers eventually prevailed, winning their right to six-hour shifts.",

A false rumor of a communist plot to take over the government, known as the \"Cohen Plan\", was also circulated through the media, although Vargas himself didn't acknowledge it.\n\nThe new government greatly expanded the power of police, persecuted political dissidents, de facto banned union activity, and allowed Vargas to rule for the next eight years under what amounted to martial law. Vargas was eventually deposed by the military in a coup launched from his own War Ministry on October 29th, 1945, after the conclusion of World War II.",

At least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was guilty later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony in the presence of Shell's lawyer.\n\nOn this day in 1995, the Ogoni nine were hanged by the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha.

At the gallows, they sang the \"Marseillaise\", then the anthem of the international revolutionary movement. Family members who attempted to see them for the last time, including notable anarchist Lucy Parsons, were arrested.\n\nAccording to witnesses, in the moments before the men were hanged, Spies shouted, \"The time will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today.\" Parsons then requested to speak, but he was cut off when the signal was given to open the trap door.",

Ordinary people will have to do extraordinary things if this planet is to survive.\"",

        "description": "On this day in 1918, the Swiss \"Landestreik\" began, a two day general strike in which 250,000 struck for a variety of social reforms, including a 48 hour week, women's suffrage, disability insurance, and the formation of people's army.\n\nThe strike took place in the context of World War I and skyrocketing food prices that left many workers hungry. As bread prices doubled between 1914 and 1918, the average industrial wages sank by a quarter. The wage of conscripted soldiers was also often less the jobs those workers were forced to abandon.\n\nIn early November, Zurich's labor movement sought to celebrate the first anniversary of the Russian October Revolution. After news of the German November Revolution and the toppling of the German emperor reached Zurich, the military banned all public demonstrations, dispersing one protest by attacking workers with saber-bearing cavalry.\n\nFollowing this incident, leaders of the Swiss Socialist Party (SPS), the country's labor unions, and the socialist press, banded together in an alliance called the Olten Action Committee (OAK), issued a proclamation of working class demands and a call for a general strike on November 12th, 1918.\n\nThe demands included a 48 hour week, women's suffrage, disability insurance, establishing a state monopoly on foreign trade, new national council elections, and the reorganization of the military into a people's army.\n\nFacing pressure from the government to end the strike and a hostile military, OAK leadership quickly backpedaled and called off the strike just two days later, on November 14th. Despite this, some workers continued to strike for several days afterward.\n\nA military court acted quickly and initiated legal proceedings against 35,000 strikers, and 21 of its leaders were tried for mutiny. In the short term, the strike's failure was a disaster for the labor movement, however many of OAK's demands would later come to fruition - in 1919, the 48 hour week was established for workers.",

In 1924, his ideas had been formally denounced as a \"petty bourgeois deviation\" in the XIIIth Party Conference, and he, along with his political ally Zinoviev, had been expelled from the Central Committee in October 1927.\n\nTrotsky was forced to leave the Soviet Union shortly after this incident, in January 1928. While in exile, he wrote several key works, including \"History of the Russian Revolution\" (1930) and \"The Revolution Betrayed (1936)\", a critique of the Soviet Union under Stalin's leadership in which he argued that the Soviet state had become a \"degenerated workers' state\" controlled by an undemocratic bureaucracy.\n\nHe eventually settled in Mexico City, continuing to advocate for his ideas and against Stalin's power. While there, he was assassinated by Ram\u00f3n Mercader, an NKVD (Soviet) agent, with an ice pick.",

Members of the Fabian Society were also present, including playwright George Bernard Shaw and Eleanor Marx.\n\n2,000 police and 400 troops were deployed to halt the demonstration and protesters, many armed with \"iron bars, knives, pokers and gas pipes\", fought back.

Inmates sat in their cells and refused to work.\n\nThe protest was mainly against the new 'Incentives and Earned Privileges Scheme', as well as anger over a series of restrictions imposed on prisoners there over the previous months, including restrictions on use of phones, on the amount of property inmates were allowed to keep, and a ban on them having property handed in by relatives and friends.\n\nThe strike lasted for at least three days, ended by the authorities sending in officers in riot gear to break it up.

In 1960, he began studying in the Soviet Union, learning Russian.\n\nWith the revolutionary party JVP, Wijeweera led two unsuccessful insurrections in Sri Lanka - the first in 1971 and the second from 1987 to 1989. Both insurrections featured revolutionary violence that was matched by brutal state repression; tens of thousands of JVP members were killed.\n\nIn 1989, during the second JVP insurrection, the Sri Lankan state launched \"Operation Combine\" to suppress the movement and assassinated Wijeweera on November 13th, 1989. In 2019, a biographical film of Wijeweera's life was released, titled \"Ginnen Upan Seethala\".\n\n\"I, a Bolshevik, am in no way a terrorist.

        "description": "Karen Gay Silkwood (1946 - 1974) was an American chemical technician and labor union activist who was possibly assassinated on this day in 1974. Silkwood is most known for raising concerns about corporate practices related to health and safety in the Kerr-McGee Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site in Oklahoma.\n\nAs an employee of Kerr-Mcgee, Silkwood made plutonium pellets and was the first woman on the union's negotiating team. After investigating her workplace, she found several health code violations and later testified to the Atomic Energy Commission about her concerns for the handling of radioactive materials at work. Shortly before her death, Silkwood's body contained 400 times the legal limit of plutonium.\n\nOn this day in 1974, while en route to meet a New York Times journalist and union official, Silkwood died in a crash where her car ran off the road. She had just left a union meeting at the Hub cafe in Crescent and was seen with a binder full of documents. None of the documents were found at the scene of the crash.\n\nAlthough foul play was not conclusively proven, skid marks from Silkwood's car were present on the road, suggesting that she was trying to get back onto the road after being pushed from behind. Investigators also noted damage on the rear of Silkwood's vehicle that was not present before the accident, and microscopic examination of the rear of Silkwood's car showed paint chips that could have come only from a rear impact by another vehicle.\n\nSilkwood's family sued Kerr-McGee on grounds of negligence, and Kerr-McGee eventually settled out of court for $1.38 million, admitting no liability. Kerr-McGee closed its nuclear fuel plants in 1975.",

        "description": "On this day in 1917 the superintendent of the Occoquan Workhouse prison ordered forty guards to brutalize suffragists, imprisoned for picketing for the right to vote in the U.S. capital.\n\nBefore November 14th, some of the activists had initiated a hunger strike to protest the conditions of the prison, the prison doctors force-fed the women by putting tubes down their throats, causing some women to vomit.\n\nOn the night of November 14th, prison guards beat Lucy Burns and chained her hands to the cell bars above her head for the entire night. They threw Dora Lewis into a dark cell and beat her unconscious.\n\nLewis's cellmate, Alice Cosu, who believed her to be dead, suffered a heart attack, and was refused medical treatment. Dorothy Day (famous for later founding Catholic Worker Movement) was slammed repeatedly over the back of an iron bench. Guards grabbed, dragged, beat, choked, pinched, and kicked other women.\n\nThe suffragists dubbed the episode the \"Night of Terror\", and the brutality was highly publicized, garnering support for the movement to give women the right to vote. On January 9th, 1918, President Woodrow Wilson (who had been specifically targeted by suffragette pickets) finally announced his support for the proposed women's suffrage amendment.",

        "description": "On this day in 1884, the \"Berlin Conference\" began when delegations from nearly every Western European country and the U.S. met in Germany to develop a set of protocols for the seizure and control of African resources.\n\nThe conference, which had no African representatives, was the first international conference ever on the subject of Africa, and dealt almost soley with the matter of its exploitation.\n\nAt the time, approximately 80% of African land and resources were under domestic control; the influence of Europeans was most strongly exerted on the coast. Following it, colonial powers began seizing resources further inland.\n\nAs a result of the conference, which continued into 1885, a \"General Act\" was signed and ratified by all but one of the 14 nations at the table, the U.S. being the sole exception. The Act's main features were the establishment of a regime of free trade stretching across the middle of Africa, the development of which became the rationale for the recognition of the short-lived \"Congo Free State\", the abolition of the overland slave trade, and the principle of \"effective occupation\".\n\nThe Conference's rapacious intentions for Africa were noted by outsiders: socialist journalist Daniel De Leon described the conference as \"an event unique in the history of political science...Diplomatic in form, it was economic in fact.\"\n\nBefore the Conference ended, the Lagos Observer declared that \"the world had, perhaps, never witnessed a robbery on so large a scale.\" Theodore Holly, the first black Protestant Episcopal Bishop in the U.S., condemned the delegates as having \"come together to enact into law, national rapine, robbery and murder\".",

        "description": "Fred Beal (1896 - 1954) was an American labor organizer who played a leading role in the Loray Mill Strike of 1929 and a former communist who renounced his beliefs upon his exile to Soviet Russia. He died on this day in 1954.\n\nIn the Loray Mill Strike, Fred Beal was a leading labor organizer, who, along with six Loray Mill workers, were indicted for the murder of a police chief that happened during the protests. Beal was convicted and skipped bail, fleeing to the Soviet Union. There, he became ambivalent about the state of the Bolshevik revolution and sought to return to the United States.\n\nAfter successfully fleeing to his home country, Beal changed his mind once more, returning to the Soviet Union and working as a manager in a Ukrainian tractor factory. It was here that he became disillusioned for good with the communist system, noting bitterly that he was still a labor organizer, facing Soviet versions of the same issues that had prompted the North Carolinians to strike, only now he was urging workers not to demand better conditions.\n\nUpon returning to the U.S., he became an anti-communist critic, publishing his experiences in a book titled \"Proletarian Journey\". According to author Matthew Disler, much of \"Proletarian Journey\" is clearly embellished, repeating dialogues from decades earlier, frequently editorializing, and mixing anecdotes from his experiences with diatribes about his enemies within the Communist movement. Bisler also claims that these inconsistencies are even worse in Beal's 1949 book, \"The Red Fraud\".\n\nAfter serving four years in prison, Beal was paroled and began working at a textile mill, participating in union activities there. He died on November 15th, 1954 of a heart attack.",

Trolley and public utility workers initiated the labor action, inspired by a successful railroad workers' strike in nearby Dur\u00e1n. Their demands were initially modest (safer working conditions, more timely pay), but grew more ambitious as the strike war on (the creation of an artificial exchange rate to manage severe currency inflation).\n\nThe strike became city-wide on November 13th, and the Ecuadorian government called on the military to suppress it. On November 15th, 1922, more than 20,000 demonstrators gathered in downtown Guayaquil and marched towards the police station. When they arrived, they were fired upon by soldiers at the station. Approximately three hundred protesters died, either by gunshot or from being stabbed by bayonets.\n\nFor most workers, this incident was the end of the strike, however many of their demands, including an exchange rate moratorium and wage increases for trolley workers, were conceded.",

Shortly thereafter, Myasnikov was expelled from the Russian Communist Party, and he formed an opposition faction called \"Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party\" that opposed the New Economic Policy (NEP).\n\nMyasnikov was arrested by the Soviet state in 1923, and served several years in prison before being exiled to Armenia, where he fled the country. In 1944, he accepted an invitation by the Soviet embassy in France to return to the USSR. Upon his arrival, he was arrested by the Soviet secret police and later executed on November 16th, 1945.",

She cleaned houses and worked as a laundress to support her family.\n\nIn 1939, the French government increased the criminal penalties for abortion, as World War II had caused a significant decline in the birth rate. Along these lines, the Vichy Regime (formed in 1940) created propaganda posters stating \"The Family is the Foundation of Society\".\n\nWhen the Nazis occupied Cherbourg in June 1940, there was an influx of prostitutes to the area and Giraud rented rooms out to them. She performed abortions on 27 women, including one who died in January 1942. An anonymous letter detailing Giraud's activities written in October 1942 led to her arrest.\n\nSuch was the prominence of Giraud's trial that the head of the Vichy Regime, Philippe P\u00e9tain, called her an immoral woman himself. She was guillotined on July 30th, 1943, the last woman to be executed by the Nazi French government.\n\nGiraud's story was dramatized in the 1988 film Story of Women, directed by Claude Chabrol. The film premiered at the 45th Venice International Film Festival, in which Isabelle Huppert was awarded the prize for best actress.",

He also participated in the Selma to Montgomery protest march in March 1965.\n\nIn September 1965, Younge was arrested and jailed after attempting to drive a group of black people to get registered to vote in Lee County, Alabama. Younge continued his efforts to get blacks registered to vote in Macon County, Alabama four months after being released from jail, up until his death.\n\nOn January 3rd, 1966, Younge was shot and killed by a gas station clerk after trying to use a \"whites only\" bathroom in his hometown of Tuskegee. Earlier that day, Younge had brought 40 people to register to vote at Macon County Courthouse, where he was threatened with a knife by a registrar.\n\nAt 21 years of age, Younge became the first black university student to be killed in the civil rights movement. His murderer was quickly arrested, indicted, and found not guilty by an all-white jury. This led to widespread protests in Tuskegee, and for the SNCC to officially oppose the Vietnam War. The SNCC issued a statement on January 6th, 1966, saying:\n\n\"We believe the United States government has been deceptive in its claims of concern for the freedom of the Vietnamese people, just as the government has been deceptive in claiming concern for the freedom of colored people in such other countries as the Dominican Republic, the Congo, South Africa, Rhodesia, and in the United States itself.\n\n...The murder of Samuel [Younge] in Tuskegee, Alabama, is no different than the murder of peasants in Vietnam, for both [Younge] and the Vietnamese sought, and are seeking, to secure the rights guaranteed them by law. In each case the United States government bears a great part of the responsibility for these deaths. Samuel [Younge] was murdered because United States law is not being enforced. Vietnamese are murdered because the United States is pursuing an aggressive policy in violation of international law.\"",

        "description": "Harry Tyson Moore, born on this day in 1905, was a civil rights activist and NAACP Florida state president who, alongside his wife Harriette, was among the first people assassinated in the civil rights movement in 1951. Harriette Moore was also a civil rights activist as well as an elementary school teacher.\n\nThrough his registration activities with the NAACP, he greatly increased its number of members. Harry Moore also advocated for better housing and education, as well as investigating lynchings, filing lawsuits against voter registration barriers, and fighting for equal pay for black teachers in public schools. In 1946, Harriette Moore and her husband were both fired by the Brevard County public school system and blacklisted due to their political activities.\n\nOn their 25th wedding anniversary (December 25th, 1951), their home in Mims, Florida was bombed. The local hospital would not treat black people, and Harry died on the way to the nearest one that would, 30 miles away in Sanford, Florida. Harriette died from her wounds nine days later, on January 3rd, 1952, at the same hospital. Their deaths were two of the earliest assassinations in the civil rights movement.\n\nAlthough the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated their murders, no one was ever prosecuted. A state investigation and forensic work in 2005 identified four Ku Klux Klan members who likely committed the bombing, however they had all been dead for many years.",

        "description": "On this day in 1909, President William Howard Taft sent U.S. warships to take position against the elected government of Nicaraguan President Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya. Taft's administration had close relations with U.S. corporations operating in Nicaragua. Those corporations were opposed to the way Zelaya defended the economic interests of his country and the region from exploitation by U.S. businesses.\n\nThe U.S. moved to remove President Zelaya after he executed two American citizens who had conspired to commit a revolution against the government. Despite the fact that Zelaya proposed a commission made up of Mexicans and Americans come to Nicaragua to investigate the executions, promising to resign if it found him guilty of any wrongdoing, President Taft ordered warships to approach both Nicaraguan coasts and marines to assemble in Panama.\n\nZelaya fled the country, stating that he would \"give no pretext\" to American hostilities. His successor Jos\u00e9 Madr\u00edz was eventually forced to resign by the American forces, and followed Zelaya into exile. Historian Stephen Kinzer has written the following about the event:\n\n\"This was the first time the United States government had explicitly orchestrated the overthrow of a foreign leader. In Hawaii, an American diplomat had managed the revolution, but without specific instructions from Washington. In Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, American 'regime change' operations were part of a larger war. The overthrow of President Zelaya in Nicaragua was the first real American coup.\"",

Willich renounced his title of nobility, joined the Communist League, and later served in the American Union Army.\n\nWillich was born in Braunsberg, Province of East Prussia, and took part in the uprising of the German revolutions in 1848-1849. Converted to republican politics, Willich's resignation from the military was written such that, instead of it being accepted, he was arrested and tried by a court-martial. Willich was eventually acquitted and was permitted to resign.\n\nWillich joined the Communist League (other members included Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels), but resigned after his suggestion to join forces with petit bourgeois democrats Marx and Engels had thrown out was not implemented. A few days later, Willich challenged Marx to a duel, which was declined.\n\nIn the early 1850s, Willich came to the United States and later served as a military officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Later in life, he became known as one of the \"Ohio Hegelians\", along with John Bernhard Stallo, Moncure Daniel Conway, and Peter Kaufmann.\n\n\"[Willich] squandered the generous proceeds of his office in visionary business schemes and on his friends, and retired with very little. His intimate friends say of him that he would throw away a hundred thousand a year if he had it, and that he could live on a hundred a year if he had to.\"\n\n- Cincinnati Commercial Tribune",

Hill, an immigrant worker frequently facing unemployment and underemployment, became a popular songwriter and cartoonist for the union.\n\nHis most famous songs include \"The Preacher and the Slave\", \"There Is Power in a Union\", and \"Casey Jones - the Union Scab\", which describes the harsh lives itinerant workers, and call for them to organize to improve their working conditions.\n\nIn 1914, John G. Morrison, a Salt Lake City area grocer and former policeman, and his son were shot and killed by two men. The same evening, Hill arrived at a doctor's office with a gunshot wound, and briefly mentioned a fight over a woman.\n\nHe refused to explain further, even after he was accused of the grocery store murders on the basis of his injury. Hill was convicted of the murders in a controversial trial and executed on this day in 1915, despite widespread calls for clemency, including from President Woodrow Wilson and Helen Keller.\n\nAfter his arrest, Hill wrote the following about his case: \"Owing to the prominence of Mr. Morrison, there had to be a 'goat' [scapegoat] and the undersigned being, as they thought, a friendless tramp, a Swede, and worst of all, an IWW, had no right to live anyway, and was therefore duly selected to be 'the goat'.\"",

He arranged picketing and sit-ins at white-only restaurants, and wade-ins at a white-only pool and beach, and was arrested many times for his activism, as well as being assaulted by the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAs he gained a reputation for militancy, Hayling was threatened with the revocation of his local NAACP chapter's charter by Executive Secretary Roy Wilkins. Hayling replied, \"I will mail you your charter\", and vowed to continue his activities without the support of the NAACP.\n\nDr. Hayling is also remembered for this quote: \"I and the others have armed. We will shoot first and answer questions later. We are not going to die like Medgar Evers.\" Dr. Hayling died in 2015, at the age of 86.",

Despite being a socialist, Thomas was a prominent member of the \"anti-Stalinist left\" in the U.S., seeking to organize with other social democrats such as Walter Reuther in promoting social reform.\n\nHe was prolific in his activism and political criticism: in the 1930s, Thomas campaigned against racial segregation, environmental depletion, anti-labor practices, and in favor of accepting Jewish refugees from Nazi persecution. When the ACLU supported Japanese-American concentration camps during World War II, he accused the organization of \"dereliction of duty\". Later, Thomas was also a vehement critic of Israel's policies towards Arabic people.\n\nThomas wrote several books, including a passionate defense of World War I conscientious objectors \"Is Conscience a Crime?\" and a statement of the 1960s social democratic consensus, \"Socialism Re-examined\".\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. called Thomas \"one of the bravest men I've ever met\". For his 80th birthday, King wrote:\n\n\"I can think of no man who has done more than you to inspire the vision of a society free of injustice and exploitation...Your pursuit of racial and economic democracy at home, and of sanity and peace in the world, has been awesome in scope. It is with deep admiration and indebtedness that I carry the inspiration of your life to Oslo.\"",

Initially supportive of the Bolshevik revolution, they soon became disillusioned, voicing their opposition to the Soviets' use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries.\n\nAmong Berkman's most notable works are \"Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist\" (1912), an account of his 14 years in prison after attempting to assassinate Frick; \"The Bolshevik Myth\" (1925), describing his experiences in Bolshevist Russia from 1920 to 1922; \"Now and After: The ABC of Communist Anarchism\" (1929), which anarchist Stuart Christie called \"among the best introductions to the ideas of anarchism in the English language\".\n\n\"No intelligent radical can fail to realize the need of the rational education of the young.\"\n\n- Alexander Berkman",

        "description": "Antonio Guiteras y Holmes, born on this day in 1906, was a revolutionary socialist in Cuba during the 1930s.\n\nBorn in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, USA, he participated in the radical government installed after the overthrow of the autocratic right wing Cuban President Gerardo Machado y Morales in 1933. He first became widely known as a student leader and associate of Julio Antonio Mella, a Cuban Communist revolutionary.\n\nIn his book \"Cuba: A New History\", the leftist historian Richard Gott wrote the following about Guiteras:\n\n\"Guiteras's views reflected an eclectic mix of revolutionary influences, from Auguste Blanqui to Jean Jacques Jaur\u00e8s. He drew inspiration from the Mexican and the Russian revolutions, the struggle in Ireland and Sandino's guerrilla movement in Nicaragua. He shared the anti-imperialist politics of the age and, drawing on anarchist roots, advocated rural and urban armed struggle, assaults on army barracks and the assassination of policemen and members of the government.\n\nHe was a firm believer in direct action, the propaganda of the deed, derived from Blanqui and the Spanish anarchists, and was much criticised by the Communists for his voluntarism and his predilection for violence.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Guiteras died in a firefight while trying to flee the country.",

To offset labor demands for better wages, local police would arrest black men nightly for minor crimes and force them to work in the mill at gunpoint.\n\nIn response to the attempted unionizing efforts, the company organized racist whites into the SPLL. Company gunmen and the SPLL assaulted union members, evicted them from company housing, burned private homes, and kidnapped and tortured organizers.\n\nOn November 21st, they shot up black labor organizer Sol Dacus's home. In a show of force the next day, Dacus marched through the town accompanied by white supporters and allies in the labor movement. The SPLL then murdered four of those white allies, including one American Federation of Labor (AFL) district representative. Dacus and his family were able to escape to New Orleans.\n\nThis incident was part of a larger period of civil unrest known as the \"American Red Summer of 1919\", including massacres and riots in Elaine, Arkansas, Chicago, Washington D.C., Knoxville, Tennessee, Wilmington, Delaware, and other cities.",

They worked in rural areas on registering black people to vote.\n\nGoodman and fellow civil rights workers Michael Schwerner and James Chaney were killed near the town of Philadelphia, Mississippi while investigating the burning of Mt. Zion Methodist Church, which had been a site for a CORE Freedom School.\n\nArrested by the local sheriff, the trio was released that evening without being allowed to contact anyone. On the road, they were stopped by patrol lights and two carloads of KKK members, kidnapped, tortured, and killed.\n\nThe sheriff, along with six others, were indicted and convicted for depriving the three men of their civil rights. No one was held accountable for their murders until 2005, when outspoken white supremacist Edgar Ray Killen was convicted on three counts of manslaughter.",

During the lockout, they armed with hurleys and bats to protect workers' demonstrations from the police.\n\nIn 1916, it took part in the Easter Rising, an armed insurrection aimed at ending British rule in Ireland. Despite the relatively small size of the army, it was more organized than the larger Irish Volunteers, with its members receiving superior training and being less affected by factional and ideological division.\n\nThe ICA became involved in the War of Independence, taking responsibility for parts of Dublin and aiding the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in various operations.",

Long excluded from churches and meetings halls for fear of mob violence, Philadelphia abolitionists had raised $40,000 to build their own (in Weld's words) \"Temple of Freedom.\" Just four days after the building opened, a mob burned it to the ground.\n\nWeld continued his abolitionist work after the act of arson, temporarily moving to Washington D.C. to help anti-slavery efforts there. In 1848, Theodore, Angelina, and Sarah also started a progressive, racially integrated school in Belleville, New Jersey.\n\n\"Every man knows that slavery is a curse.

Not wanting to be boxed in, black strikers fired on the city border guards. In retaliation, the paramilitary forces initiated three days of violence against mostly unarmed black workers and their families.\n\nEstimates of the total number of dead range from 35-60, making it one of the deadliest strikes in American labor history. Despite the women and children killed, the Southern press heralded the white perpetrators of the violence.\n\nOne participant, Andrew Price, went on to be elected to Congress. Black farmworkers in the region did not make another large effort to unionize until the 1940s.",

For their acts of subversion, Mar\u00eda, Minerva, both of their husbands, and Patria's husband were all imprisoned.\n\nAfter being freed, Patria, Minerva, Mar\u00eda Teresa, and their driver, Rufino de la Cruz, were attacked after visiting Mar\u00eda's and Minerva's incarcerated husbands. On the way home, the sisters and de la Cruz were separated, strangled, and clubbed to death by state forces.\n\nThe bodies were then gathered and put in their Jeep, which was run off the mountain road in an attempt to make their deaths look like an accident.\n\nThe assassinations turned the Mirabal sisters into \"symbols of both popular and feminist resistance\", according to the New York Times. In their honor, the United Nations General Assembly designated the 25th of November as \"International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women\" in 1999.",

Van der Veen helped forge more than 80,000 ethnic identity papers.\n\nDutch historian Robert-Jan van Pelt has written the following about van der Veen:\n\n\"In 1940, after the German occupation, van der Veen was one of the few who refused to sign the so-called \"Arierverklaring\", the Declaration of Aryan Ancestry. In the years that followed, he tried to help Jews both in practical and symbolic ways.\n\nTogether with the musician Jan van Gilse and the (openly homosexual) artist, art historian, and critic Willem Arondeus, van der Veen established the underground organization De Vrije Kunstenaar (The Free Artist).\n\nVan der Veen and the other artists published a newsletter calling for resistance against the occupation. When the Germans introduced identity documents (Persoonsbewijzen) that distinguished between Jews and non-Jews, van der Veen, Arondeus and the printer Frans Duwaer produced some 80,000 false identity papers.\"\n\nVan der Veen tried to escape his comrades from prison in May 1944, but the attempt failed and van der Veen was paralyzed after being shot. He was arrested a few weeks later and then executed on June 10th, 1944. In May 1946, he was awarded the Dutch Cross of Resistance.",

He was a leading member of the \"Tachtigers\", a highly influential group of Dutch writers who worked together in Amsterdam in the 1880s.\n\nGorter's first book, a 4,000 verse epic poem called \"Mei\" (May), helped establish his reputation as a great writer upon its publication in 1889, and is regarded by critics as the pinnacle of Dutch Impressionist literature.\n\nGorter was also an outspoken advocate of revolutionary communism and Marxist theory. In 1917, he hailed the Russian Revolution as the beginning of that global revolution and had correspondence with Lenin on multiple occasions, wishing him well and asking for his support in condemning Dutch social democrats for not condemning American imperialism.\n\nLenin sent Gorter a copy of \"State and Revolution\" in response, which Gorter then offered to translate.\n\n\"Your words will be an incentive to me, once again, and to an even greater extent than before, to base my judgement in all matters of tactics, also in the revolution, exclusively on reality, on the actual class-relations, as they manifest themselves politically and economically.\"\n\n- Herman Gorter, in \"Open Letter to Comrade Lenin\"",

        "description": "On this day in 2020, the largest strike in world history began in India when 250 million workers from across the country struck both in solidarity with farmers protesting en masse and to demand better working conditions for themselves.\n\nThe strike took place following months of protest from Indian farmers, a response to three farm acts passed by the Parliament of India in September 2020. According to protesters, the farm acts would leave small farmers, the vast majority, at the mercy of large corporations. Poor farmers were already desperate before the laws were passed - in 2019 alone, 10,281 agricultural workers committed suicide.\n\nDozens of farm unions began organizing protests demanding the repeal of these laws. After failing to get the support of their respective state governments, the farmers decided to pressure the Central Government by marching to Delhi en masse.\n\nThe farmers arrived at Delhi on November 25th, 2020 and were met by police, who employed the use of tear gas and water cannons, dug up roads, and used layers of barricades and sand barriers to try and stop their march.\n\nOn November 26th, 250 million workers from all over the country initiated a general strike in solidarity with the farmer's struggle. According to Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research, trade unions issued a twelve-point charter of demands which included \"the reversal of the anti-worker, anti-farmer laws pushed by the government in September, the reversal of the privatisation of major government enterprises, and immediate [Covid] relief for the population\".\n\nFarmer protests continued for more than a year, featuring mass marches, clashes with police, and many failed negotiations between farmers' unions and the government. Rakesh Tikait, a leader with Bharatiya Kisan Union (English: Indian Farmers' Union) stated in October 2021 that approximately 750 participants have died in the protest.\n\nAmong the dead was a Senior Superintendent of Police in the city of Sonepat, who committed suicide, saying he could not bear the pain of the farmers. His suicide note read \"Bullets fired from the guns kill only those whom they strike. The bullet of injustice, however, kills many with a single stroke... It is humiliating to suffer injustice.\"\n\nIn a televised address on November 19th, 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that his government would repeal the three acts in the upcoming winter parliamentary session in December. The national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, Rakesh Tikait, stated the protests would only cease once the laws were repealed.\n\nThe film actor Deep Sidhu also joined the protests, and was quoted as having told a police officer the following: \"Ye inquilab hai. This is a revolution. If you take away farmers' land, then what do they have left? Only debt.\"",

For example, the Makhnovists, often cited as a form of government (with Nestor Makhno as their \"leader\"), were ostensibly organized to serve in a purely military role, with Makhno himself functioning as more of a strategist than commander.\n\nThe economy of Makhnovia varied by region, from \"market socialism\" to anarcho-communism in character. Where money was used, production was often organized in the form of worker cooperatives.\n\nThe Bolsheviks were openly hostile to the Free Territory. On November 26th, 1920, less than two weeks after the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army assisted Bolshevik forces in defeating the White Army, Makhno's headquarters staff and many of his subordinate commanders were arrested at a Red Army planning conference to which they had been invited by Moscow, and executed.\n\nMakhno himself fled the region several months later, settling in Paris, France.",

Milk unsuccessfully ran for office three times, but finally won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977.\n\nMilk was assassinated on this day in 1978, after only eleven months in office. He was killed by Dan White, a disgruntled former city supervisor.\n\nDuring Milk's short time in office, he sponsored a bill banning discrimination in public accommodations, housing, and employment on the basis of sexual orientation. After his death, Milk became an icon in San Francisco and a martyr for the gay community.\n\nIn 2021, the U.S. Navy launched a ship named after Harvey Milk, who had been discharged from the Navy during the Korean War after being questioned about his sexual orientation.",

Faye was spared for her ability to develop photographs, and the Nazis ordered Faye to develop their photographs of the massacre. Later, she cited taking a photo of her dead family in a mass grave as the impetus to take up arms.\n\nDuring a partisan raid on the camp, Faye fled to the forests and joined the Molotava Brigade, a partisan group mostly comprised of escaped Soviet Red Army POWs. She was accepted because her brother-in-law had been a doctor and they were desperate for anyone who knew anything about medicine. Faye served the group as a nurse from September 1942 to July 1944, even though she had no previous medical experience.\n\nDuring another raid on the Lenin ghetto, Faye succeeded in recovering her old photographic equipment. During the next two years, she took over a hundred photographs, developing the medium format negatives under blankets and making \"sun prints\" during the day. While on missions, Faye buried the camera and tripod to keep it safe. Schulman is the only known Jewish partisan photographer from this era.\n\nAfter the war, Faye and her husband Morris left for a displaced-persons camp in West Germany, where they smuggled people and weapons to support the movement for an independent Israel, making plans to emigrate to British-controlled Palestine themselves.\n\n\"I want people to know that there was resistance.

His father owned large textile factories in Barmen and Salford, England. His revolutionary predilections (and later, his atheistic beliefs) put him at odds with his family, who expected Engels to inherit the family business.\n\nEngels' career became intertwined with Marx's when he began writing articles for \"Rheinische Zeitung\", a German newspaper that Karl Marx edited. In 1845, Engels published \"The Condition of the Working Class in England\", based on personal observations and research of poverty and disease in English cities. In 1848, Engels co-authored the \"Communist Manifesto\" with Marx.\n\nLater, Engels supported Marx financially, allowing him to perform research and write \"Das Kapital\". After Marx's death, Engels edited the second and third volumes of \"Das Kapital\".\n\nAdditionally, Engels organized Marx's notes into \"Theories of Surplus Value\", which were later published as the fourth volume of \"Das Kapital\".

Prominent figures arrested included a Catholic priest Georges Darboy and the archbishop of Paris. The Commune hoped to exchange their hostages for Louis-Auguste Blanqui, a revolutionary and honorary President of the Commune, imprisoned by the state.\n\nFollowing the events of the \"Bloody Week\", in which the French government summarily executed many suspected Communards, Ferr\u00e9 authorized the execution of several hostages, including Darboy and the archbishop.\n\nAfter the resistance of the Commune collapsed, Ferr\u00e9 was captured by the army, tried by a military court, and sentenced to death.

        "description": "Lau Mazirel, born on this day in 1907, was a member of the anti-Nazi Dutch resistance during WWII who helped organize a bombing campaign, jumped on transport trains to rescue Jewish children, and advocated for queer and Romani people.\n\nMazirel was born to pacifists who helped refugees during World War I, growing up in the southern province of Limburg. In 1929, she moved to Amsterdam, where she became an active member of the social democratic student organization Sociaal Democratische Studenten Club (SDSC) and the social democratic party Sociaal-Democratische Arbeiderspartij (SDAP).\n\nAmong Mazirel's efforts as part of the anti-Nazi resistance in the Netherlands were helping organize the 1943 bombing of the Amsterdam civil registry office, rescuing Jewish children from concentration camp trains, and using her law firm to focus on cases involving refugees and immigrants. Her law office was raided three times by the Nazi state. In 1944, Mazirel was arrested and served six weeks in prison.\n\nMazirel was also an early advocate of both LGBT rights and the rights of Romani people. After World War II, she served as attorney for the LGBT rights organisation Cultuur en Ontspanningscentrum (COC), founded in 1946. She also fought against the racist 1968 \"Woonwagenwet\" legislation, which targeted Romani people.\n\n\"I wish there were people who would take over from me, who would go and see for themselves, seeing and realizing why I scream so loud and still have to deal with refugees for the genocide.\"\n\n- Lau Mazirel",

This violence took place despite the fact that Black Kettle, a chief known for advocating peace, was flying a U.S. and white flag over his lodge to forestall any possible attack.\n\nTwo officers of the attacking forces, Captain Silas Soule and Lieutenant Joseph Cramer, refused to obey the order to attack the camp. The rest of the soldiers complied, killing all present, regardless of age. They murdered children and took trophies, cutting off the fingers, ears, noses, and testicles of the fallen as keepsakes.\n\nChief Ochinee (One-Eye) managed to escape from the camp, but, seeing the massacre unfolding, returned to die with his people. A survivor of the massacre, a 24-year old woman named Mochni, became a warrior afterward, participating in raids against colonizers until her incarceration and death.\n\nMany people who had previously supported peace with the United States joined the \"Dog Soldiers\", an indigenous group that engaged against guerilla warfare against the state and would-be settlers on their land.",

        "description": "Samuel Clemens, better known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an American writer, humorist, and anti-imperialist born on this day in 1835. He was lauded as the \"greatest humorist [the United States] has produced\", and William Faulkner called him \"the father of American literature\". After 1899, he was also a committed anti-imperialist and anti-racist.\n\nBefore 1899, however, he supported imperialism, calling the Spanish War \"the worthiest\" war the U.S. ever fought. In the New York Herald, he described his anti-imperialism epiphany like this:\n\n\"I wanted the American eagle to go screaming into the Pacific ... Why not spread its wings over the Philippines, I asked myself? ... I said to myself, Here are a people who have suffered for three centuries. We can make them as free as ourselves, give them a government and country of their own, put a miniature of the American Constitution afloat in the Pacific, start a brand new republic to take its place among the free nations of the world. It seemed to me a great task to which we had addressed ourselves.\"\n\n\"But I have thought some more, since then, and I have read carefully the treaty of Paris [which ended the Spanish-American War], and I have seen that we do not intend to free, but to subjugate the people of the Philippines. We have gone there to conquer, not to redeem.\"\n\nFrom 1901 until his death in 1910, Twain was vice-president of the American Anti-Imperialist League, which believed that there is a fundamental contradiction between the ideas upon which the American republic was founded and designs for colonial expansion being advanced by the nation's contemporary political leaders.",

Protesters surrounded the WTO Ministerial Conference, which was to be the launch of a new millennial round of trade negotiations. The negotiations were quickly overshadowed by the massive street protests outside the hotels and the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, estimated to have more than 40,000 participants.\n\nThe protests were a mix of permitted rallies and marches (involving the AFL-CIO) and direct action from anarchists and other political radicals. By noon, the opening ceremony of the conference had been canceled due to protest control and vandalism of intersections downtown, and that night the Mayor declared a state of emergency. Police began gassing and arresting people indiscriminately, sometimes targeting bystanders who weren't participating in the protests. By December 1st, 500 people had been jailed.\n\nTo many in North American anarchist and radical circles, the Seattle WTO riots, protests, and demonstrations were viewed as a success - prior to the \"Battle of Seattle\", almost no mention was made of \"anti-globalization\" in the U.S. media, while the protests were seen as having forced the media to report on 'why' anybody would oppose the WTO. Controversy over the city's response to the protests resulted in the resignation of the police chief of Seattle, Norm Stamper.",

When she was five, she was sent to live with her maternal grandmother in Barbados because her parents' work schedules made it difficult to raise children.\n\nChisholm returned to the United States at the age of ten, and spoke with a slight West Indies accent for the rest of her life. On her grandmother's influence, Chisholm later stated \"Granny gave me strength, dignity, and love. I learned from an early age that I was somebody. I didn't need the black revolution to tell me that.\"\n\nIn 1968, she became the first black woman elected to the United States Congress in an upset victory where she defeated civil rights activist James Farmer. Her campaign slogan, later the title of her autobiography, was \"Unbought and Unbossed\".\n\nChisholm represented New York's 12th congressional district for seven terms from 1969 to 1983. In the 1972 United States presidential election, she became the first black candidate for a major party's nomination for President of the United States.\n\n\"In the end anti-black, anti-female, and all forms of discrimination are equivalent to the same thing: anti-humanism.\"\n\n- Shirley Chisholm",
