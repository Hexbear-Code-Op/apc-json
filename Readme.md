# A People's Calendar JSON data

## What is A People's Calendar?

From www.apeoplescalendar.org/about

>A People's Calendar (aPC) is a project that seeks to promote the worldwide history of working class movements and liberation struggles in the form of a searchable "On This Day" calendar.
>
>aPC was inspired by historian Howard Zinn's work "A People's History of the United States". Zinn's scholarship and political activism demonstrated the power of mass working class movements, as well as the critical importance of knowing this history when we seek to change the present.
>
>The greatest experts on any historical event or struggle will always be the people who live it, as well as the scholars who document it meticulously. Our ambition is to promote awareness of this history while emphasizing these perspectives.

## What is A People's Calendar JSON?

Using information found in the A People's Calendar GitHub page, I was able to query all events from the sites database and export them as a JSON file. I will periodically export this data and commit the changes so that there is a running change log of the events, and so others can use this JSON with out needing access to the A People's Calendar database. I didn't want to pull data from their database constantly, so instead I figured I would pull this JSON file and make it available for others to use.

I also plan on using this JSON data to create .ics files that can be pulled into your calendar application of choice, allowing you to see the events in your personal calendar.
